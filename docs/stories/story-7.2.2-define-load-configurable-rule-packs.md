# Story 7.2.2: Define and Load Configurable Rule Packs

## Epic
[Epic 7.2: Threat Analysis Engine](docs/epics/epic-7.2-threat-analysis-engine.md)

## Description
As a backend developer, I want to define and load configurable rule packs (e.g., YAML/JSON) so that the Threat Analysis Engine can identify various hazard conditions based on correlated data. These rule packs should be LGU-specific.

## Functional Requirements
- **FR 5.2.2:** The system shall apply predefined, configurable rule packs (e.g., YAML/JSON) to correlated data to identify potential threats.
- **FR 5.5.5:** The dashboard shall support LGU management (CRUD for Admin role), including configuration of rule packs and communication settings.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **GIVEN** a set of correlated data from various sources
- **AND** a configured rule pack for a specific LGU
- **WHEN** the Threat Analysis Engine evaluates the correlated data
- **THEN** the engine shall correctly apply the rules defined in the LGU's rule pack.
- **AND** the system shall be able to load different rule packs based on the active LGU context.

## Technical Notes
- Implement a rule engine or a mechanism to parse and apply rules defined in YAML/JSON format.
- Store rule packs in the database (e.g., `lgus.configuration` JSONB field or a dedicated `rule_packs` table).
- Ensure the Threat Analysis Engine can dynamically load the appropriate rule pack based on the geospatial context of the correlated data or the active LGU.
- Define a clear schema for rule pack configuration, including conditions, thresholds, and resulting alert severities.
