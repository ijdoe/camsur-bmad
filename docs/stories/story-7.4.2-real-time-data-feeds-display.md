## Epic
[Epic 7.4: Admin/Operator Dashboard](docs/epics/epic-7.4-admin-operator-dashboard.md)

## Description
As an operator, I want to view real-time feeds of the latest sensor readings and CCTV events in the dashboard so I can stay updated on critical data points and quickly identify anomalies.

## Functional Requirements
- **FR 5.5.2:** The dashboard shall provide real-time data feeds for latest sensor readings and CCTV events.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **GIVEN** the operator is logged into the Admin/Operator Dashboard
- **WHEN** new simulated sensor readings or CCTV events are ingested
- **THEN** dedicated data panels in the dashboard shall update in real-time to display the latest information.
- **AND** the data feeds shall clearly indicate the source, timestamp, and value of each reading/event.
- **AND** the dashboard shall provide a summary of active alerts.

## Technical Notes
- Implement WebSocket integration in the frontend to receive real-time updates for sensor readings and CCTV events.
- Design dedicated UI components for displaying these data feeds (e.g., cards, small tables).
- Ensure efficient rendering of real-time data to maintain dashboard performance.
- Integrate with the Alert Management Service to fetch and display the alert summary.
