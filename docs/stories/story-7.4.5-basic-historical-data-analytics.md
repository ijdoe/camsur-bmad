# Story 7.4.5: Basic Historical Data and Analytics

## Epic
[Epic 7.4: Admin/Operator Dashboard](docs/epics/epic-7.4-admin-operator-dashboard.md)

## Description
As an operator, I want to see basic historical data and trends (e.g., sensor trends, alert frequency) in the dashboard so I can understand past events and system performance over time.

## Functional Requirements
- **FR 5.5.6:** The dashboard shall display basic historical data and analytics (e.g., sensor trends, alert frequency).

## Acceptance Criteria
- **GIVEN** the operator is logged into the Admin/Operator Dashboard
- **WHEN** the operator navigates to a historical data view or relevant dashboard section
- **THEN** the dashboard shall display charts or graphs showing trends for:
    -   Selected IoT sensor readings over time.
    -   Frequency of `system_alerts` over a configurable period.
- **AND** the operator shall be able to select time ranges for the historical data display.

## Technical Notes
- Implement API endpoints in backend services to retrieve historical sensor data (from TimescaleDB) and alert data (from PostgreSQL/Elasticsearch).
- Use a charting library (e.g., Chart.js, Recharts) in the frontend to render the historical data.
- Design UI components for selecting time ranges and filtering data for charts.
- Ensure efficient data retrieval for historical queries to maintain dashboard responsiveness.
