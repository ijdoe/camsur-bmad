# Story 7.6.3: Multi-Tenancy Data Isolation

## Epic
[Epic 7.6: Security & Multi-Tenancy](docs/epics/epic-7.6-security-multi-tenancy.md)

## Description
As a developer, I want to implement strict data isolation between LGUs so that each client's data and configurations are completely separate and secure, ensuring multi-tenancy.

## Functional Requirements
- **FR 5.7.3:** The system shall support multi-tenancy with strict data isolation between LGUs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **GIVEN** an authenticated user belonging to LGU A
- **WHEN** the user queries for data (e.g., alerts, sensor readings)
- **THEN** the system shall only return data associated with LGU A.
- **AND** a user belonging to LGU A shall not be able to access or modify data belonging to LGU B.
- **AND** LGU-specific configurations (e.g., rule packs, communication templates) shall only apply to their respective LGU.

## Technical Notes
- Implement data filtering at the database query level (e.g., always include `WHERE lgu_id = :userLguId`).
- Ensure all backend services enforce LGU context for data access and modification.
- The `users` and `lgus` data models are designed to support this relationship.
- Carefully design API endpoints to prevent cross-LGU data leakage.
- Consider using database schemas or row-level security for more robust isolation if needed (beyond MVP scope, but good to note).
