# Story 7.6.2: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## Epic
[Epic 7.6: Security & Multi-Tenancy](docs/epics/epic-7.6-security-multi-tenancy.md)

## Description
As a developer, I want to implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) so that different user roles (Admin, Operator, Viewer) have appropriate permissions to access specific functionalities and data within the system.

## Functional Requirements
- **FR 5.7.2:** The system shall implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for different user roles (Admin, Operator, Viewer).

## Acceptance Criteria
- **GIVEN** a user is authenticated with a specific role (Admin, Operator, Viewer)
- **WHEN** the user attempts to access an API endpoint or UI feature
- **THEN** the system shall grant or deny access based on the user's role and the defined permissions.
- **AND** Admin users shall have full access to user and LGU management.
- **AND** Operator users shall have access to alert review, approval, and communication generation, but not user/LGU management.
- **AND** Viewer users shall have read-only access to the dashboard and alerts.
- **AND** unauthorized access attempts shall result in an appropriate error response.

## Technical Notes
- Implement RBAC logic within the backend services (e.g., using NestJS guards/interceptors).
- Define roles and their associated permissions (e.g., `can_manage_users`, `can_approve_alerts`).
- Store user roles in the `users` data model.
- The frontend should dynamically adjust UI elements (e.g., hide/disable buttons, navigation items) based on the authenticated user's role.
- Ensure API endpoints are protected with appropriate authorization checks.
