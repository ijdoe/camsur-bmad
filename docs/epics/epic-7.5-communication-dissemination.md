# Epic 7.5: Communication & Dissemination

## Description
Develop the capabilities for generating and simulating the delivery of targeted alerts. This epic focuses on the backend service responsible for creating localized messages based on approved alerts and predefined templates, and simulating their dissemination.

## Functional Requirements (from PRD)
- **FR 5.4.1:** The system shall generate localized SMS content based on approved alerts and predefined templates.
- **FR 5.4.2:** The system shall generate pre-formatted radio broadcast scripts based on approved alerts and templates.
- **FR 5.4.3:** The system shall generate official alerts for barangay officials based on approved alerts and templates.
- **FR 5.4.4:** The system shall support multi-language generation for communication templates (for demo purposes).
- **FR 5.4.5:** The system shall *simulate* sending of SMS alerts and radio broadcasts for demo purposes.

## Technical Specifications (from Technical Specification)
- **Backend Service:** Communication Service
    - **Endpoints:** `POST /communications/generate-sms`, `POST /communications/generate-radio`, `POST /communications/generate-barangay`
    - **Logic:** Uses predefined templates and alert data to generate localized, actionable messages. For MVP, this will generate text content, not send actual messages.
- **Frontend Components (from UX Spec):** Communication Preview within Alert Detail Panel.

## User Stories (To be defined)
- As an operator, I want the system to generate localized SMS content for an approved alert so I can quickly prepare messages for affected communities.
- As an operator, I want the system to generate pre-formatted radio broadcast scripts so I can provide clear instructions to local radio stations.
- As an operator, I want the system to generate official alerts for barangay officials so they have clear guidance for local response.
- As an operator, I want to preview the generated communication messages before simulated dissemination so I can ensure accuracy.
- As a developer, I want to implement multi-language support for communication templates so the system can be demonstrated in various local dialects.
