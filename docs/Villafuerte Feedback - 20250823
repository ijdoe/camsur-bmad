Lray Villafuerte New: Pls send a proposal with scope of work etc so we can review and consider

Lray Villafuerte New: I don't know what the objective and benefit of having a customized platform at this time. We don't need an ai that understands departments, projects and goals. We dint need an ai tool to achieve the above. We also don't need an ai platform to enable us to respond faster from budgets and disaster alerts.

Lray Villafuerte New: We just need a system to notify when there's a disaster. We dint need ai to be honest for disaster alerts and notifications

Lray Villafuerte New: Text messages, radio messages, social media notifications and alerting barangay officials through all of the above plus house to house notifications, alarms, bells and others is more effective

Lray Villafuerte New: Majority don't have cell homes majority don't have computers and email. I don't know how ai can help in disaster alerts z

Lray Villafuerte New: We also don't need ai to determine and act on our budget

Lray Villafuerte New: We can use ai on so many ways but definitely not to help us on our data (what data?) we don't need ai to determine our programs and projects . How can ai help us decide faster through a customized platform. Even if you put all of this in an app. Pls understand ordinary people will not be able to access the app - first because they don't have a cellphone, secondly they need internet access (while we are providing free wifi), majority still dont have wifi
