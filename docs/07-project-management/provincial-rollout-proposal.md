## 1. Executive Summary: A Vision for a Safer Province

The Provincial Government of Camarines Sur has a unique opportunity to set a new national standard in disaster resilience. This proposal outlines a strategic, multi-phase partnership to implement **Project LINGKOD**, a state-of-the-art early warning and decision support system designed to protect the lives and livelihoods of every citizen in the province.

We propose a pragmatic, phased approach that begins with a focused pilot program in high-risk areas, followed by a systematic province-wide expansion. This strategy ensures that the solution is not just technologically advanced, but also perfectly attuned to the unique operational realities of Camarines Sur.

Project LINGKOD is more than a software platform; it is a strategic investment in effective governance, public safety, and economic stability. By providing your leadership with the tools to anticipate and act before disaster strikes, we can build a safer, more resilient future for the entire province.

## 2. The Challenge: Closing the Last-Mile Information Gap

We understand the complexities of disaster management in a province as diverse as Camarines Sur. The core challenge is translating broad, regional warnings into specific, life-saving actions at the community level. Project LINGKOD is engineered to solve this "last-mile" problem by providing a centralized intelligence hub that delivers hyper-local, actionable insights to your PDRRMO and municipal leaders.

## 3. The Solution: A Phased Provincial Rollout

We recommend a strategic, three-phase rollout to ensure a successful and sustainable implementation. This approach manages risk, demonstrates value early, and allows the system to scale intelligently across the province.

### **Phase 1: Pilot Implementation & Validation (5 Months)**

We will begin by deploying the core Project LINGKOD system in **3 to 4 high-risk, representative municipalities**. This allows us to work closely with your PDRRMO and local teams to refine the system in a real-world environment, ensuring it is perfectly calibrated to the province's needs before wider deployment.

### **Phase 2: Province-Wide Expansion (6 Months)**

Following a successful pilot, we will systematically expand the system to cover **all remaining municipalities and cities** in Camarines Sur. This phase focuses on structured onboarding, comprehensive training for all local DRRMOs, and scaling the technical infrastructure to support the entire province.

### **Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities & Integration (Ongoing)**

With the provincial system fully operational, we can enhance its capabilities with advanced, high-value modules. These can be implemented based on the province's evolving strategic priorities and include options like live third-party data integration, advanced machine learning for predictive analytics, and a full-featured public information portal.

## 4. Strategic Investment Summary

The total investment for Project LINGKOD is broken down into two clear categories: a **One-Time Implementation Investment** for the design and deployment of the system, and **Recurring Operational Costs** for the ongoing hosting and maintenance of the platform.

### **Part A: One-Time Implementation Investment**

This covers the professional services required to build, configure, and deploy the Project LINGKOD platform.

**Phase 1: Pilot Implementation & Validation**
| Item | Description | Cost (PHP) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pilot Program Investment** | A fixed fee covering all development, project management, and training for the 5-month pilot phase, inclusive of all development-phase infrastructure and tooling costs. | **4,150,000** |
| **Implementation Travel Budget** | A fixed budget to cover all travel, accommodation, and expenses for the Manila-based team during the pilot phase. | **400,000** |
| **Total Phase 1 Investment** | | **4,550,000** |


**Phase 2: Province-Wide Expansion**
| Item | Description | Cost (PHP) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LGU Onboarding Fee** | A one-time fee per municipality for system configuration, on-site training, and go-live support. Travel expenses to be billed separately. | **406,000** |
| **Total Expansion Investment** | (LGU Onboarding Fee) x (Number of remaining LGUs) | *To be calculated* |

### **Part B: Annual Platform & Operations Investment**

To provide the budget certainty required for government planning, we offer a fixed-price annual service package. This all-inclusive fee covers all cloud hosting, platform maintenance, SMS/mapping allowances, and technical support. Costs related to third-party CCTV analytics services are excluded.

**Annual Service Tiers (for Pilot Phase)**

| Feature | **Standard Tier** | **Professional Tier** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Included Municipalities** | Up to 4 | Up to 4 |

| **Fixed Annual Cost (PHP)** | **1,080,000** | **1,320,000** |

*   ***Note:** The final tier and pricing will be customized based on the specific needs of the pilot municipalities. Overage rates for services beyond the package allowance will be pre-defined in the final agreement. Costs for province-wide expansion will be re-evaluated following the pilot.*
