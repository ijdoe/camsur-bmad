This document outlines a strategic technology partnership between Getaka Labs and RDG Digital Consulting. We are proposing to provide the **LINGKOD Intelligence Platform** as the core technology for RDG's bid to the Provincial Government of Camarines Sur.

This proposal details the platform's capabilities, a recommended phased rollout, clear deliverables, and a partnership model designed for mutual success. By combining Getaka Labs' deep technology expertise with RDG's consulting and implementation leadership, we can deliver an unparalleled disaster resilience solution for Camarines Sur and establish a new standard for public safety systems in the Philippines.

This document is intended to equip RDG Digital Consulting with the comprehensive technical and strategic information required to submit a confident and compelling proposal to the provincial government.

## 2. The Opportunity: A Joint Solution for a National Challenge

The core challenge in disaster management is translating broad, regional warnings into specific, life-saving actions at the community level. Project LINGKOD is engineered to solve this "last-mile" problem. As the technology provider, Getaka Labs offers a platform that can serve as the engine for RDG's solution, delivering hyper-local, actionable insights to the PDRRMO and municipal leaders of Camarines Sur.

## 3. The LINGKOD Intelligence Platform: A Deeper Look

**Project LINGKOD: Turning Information into Action, and Action into Safety.**

The **LINGKOD Emergency Command Platform** is an AI-powered intelligence engine and command console that fuses real-time data from multiple sources to deliver hyper-local, predictive alerts. It transforms disaster management from a reactive to a proactive discipline by telling operators not just “what is happening,” but “what will likely happen next,” at the barangay level.

### 3.1 Core Modules and Functionalities

The platform is comprised of several integrated modules designed to provide a seamless, end-to-end workflow from data ingestion to public dissemination.

*   **Multi-Source Intelligence Fusion:** Connectors to diverse data sources, including national advisories (e.g., PAG-ASA), AI-powered CCTV analytics, hydrology IoT networks, and satellite imagery providers.
*   **Community Intelligence Module (CIM):** A dedicated module for ingesting and analyzing multi-lingual voice and text reports from citizens, using NLP to identify critical information and sentiment.
*   **Insight Generation Engine:** The "AI brain" of the system. This engine correlates multiple signals to generate predictive, high-confidence insights with clear explanations.
*   **Dynamic Insight Briefing Dashboard:** The primary operator console, featuring a configurable, widget-based interface with components for `Situational Overview`, `Critical Observations`, `Street-Level Hotspots`, `Predictive Risk Outlook`, and `Strategic Recommendations`.
*   **Last-Mile Communication Hub:** A one-click system for disseminating localized, template-based alerts via SMS and radio scripts to pre-approved recipients.
*   **External Integration Gateway:** A standards-based API (CAP, GeoJSON) that allows cities with existing command centers to consume LINGKOD's intelligence within their own systems.

### 3.2 How LINGKOD Enhances National Advisories

LINGKOD does not replace national agencies like PAG-ASA; it amplifies their value by providing critical local context.

| Aspect | **PAG-ASA / National Agencies** | **LINGKOD Intelligence Platform** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scope** | Province / Region-wide Advisories | Barangay-level Risk Projections |
| **Data** | Meteorological & Seismic Data | Fused Data: Weather + Local CCTV, River Levels, Satellite Imagery |
| **Output** | Typhoon Signals, Rainfall Warnings | Impact-based Alerts: "Flash flood likely in Brgy. San Roque in 90 mins" |
| **Focus** | "What is happening" | "What will likely happen next, and where" |

### 3.3 Sample Intelligence Categories & Outputs

To make the system's value tangible, here are examples of the actionable intelligence the LINGKOD platform will produce.

*   **Source: AI-Powered CCTV**
    *   **Categories:** Urban flooding, traffic obstruction, critical infrastructure status.
    *   **Sample Output:** "AI CCTV detects water at Barlin Bridge has risen to curb level. Risk of road being impassable in 30 mins."
*   **Source: Hydrology IoT Network**
    *   **Categories:** River level, rainfall intensity, flood probability.
    *   **Sample Output:** "IoT sensors show the Ragay River is at a critical threshold and rising, with intense upstream rainfall. High probability of flash floods in downstream communities within 3 hours."
*   **Source: Satellite Imagery**
    *   **Categories:** Landslide risk zones, widespread flood area potential, post-disaster damage assessment.
    *   **Sample Output:** "Satellite analysis shows high soil saturation on Mount Isarog. Increased landslide risk for specific barangays at the base."
*   **Source: Community Intelligence**
    *   **Categories:** On-the-ground observations, resource needs, misinformation tracking.
    *   **Sample Output:** "NLP analysis of multiple citizen reports from Brgy. San Vicente indicates a rising panic due to misinformation about a dam failure. Recommend immediate deployment of a public information team to the area to disseminate accurate information."
*   **Example of a Fused Alert:**
    *   **CRITICAL FUSED ALERT:** "PAG-ASA's Typhoon Signal #4, combined with our IoT data (critical river level) and CCTV data (key bridge flooding), indicates a 95% probability of severe, widespread flooding in Naga City's central business district within the next 60 minutes. **Recommendation:** Activate city-wide evacuation plan immediately."

### 3.4 A Community-Powered Approach to Resilience

Project LINGKOD transforms citizens from passive recipients of warnings into active partners in disaster management. Our **Community Intelligence Module (CIM)** empowers residents to report on-the-ground conditions, resource needs, and potential hazards in real-time. This creates a rich, hyper-local data source that complements our other systems and fosters a whole-of-community approach to safety.

### 3.5 Human-in-the-Loop: Ensuring Trust & Accountability

LINGKOD is a decision support tool, not an automated decision-maker. Every insight generated by the **LINGKOD Insight Generation Engine** requires review and approval by a human operator before any public dissemination. This critical "human-in-the-loop" design ensures:
*   **Accuracy:** Prevents false alarms by allowing operators to apply their local knowledge and context.
*   **Accountability:** Maintains a clear chain of command and responsibility for public warnings.
*   **Trust:** Builds confidence in the system among both operators and the public.

### 3.5 Phase 1 Insight Catalog: From Data to Decision

During the pilot phase, the LINGKOD platform will be configured to generate the following high-value, actionable insights using publicly available data and LGU-supplied information, requiring no dependency on formal MOUs.

| Insight | Description | Example Actionable Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Barangay Flood Watch** | Combines PAGASA rainfall warnings with MGB flood susceptibility maps and river data to project potential flooding within a 2-6 hour window. | "High confidence flood watch for Brgys. San Felipe and San Roque. Exposed Population: 8,500. Recommend pre-positioning rescue boats and alerting BDRRMCs." |
| **Barangay Landslide Watch** | Fuses persistent rainfall warnings with MGB landslide susceptibility maps and local slope data to identify areas at risk within a 6-24 hour window. | "Medium confidence landslide watch for Brgy. Sta. Cruz due to soil saturation. Key access road at risk. Recommend advising residents to prepare for possible evacuation." |
| **Quake Rapid Impact Est.** | Translates PHIVOLCS earthquake alerts into estimated ground shaking intensity per barangay, flagging critical facilities in high-impact zones. | "Magnitude 5.1 quake detected. Estimated Intensity IV in Naga City. Recommending immediate structural integrity checks for Naga City Hospital and the Panganiban Bridge." |
| **Hotspot Escalation Score** | A dynamic, composite score that ranks barangays by escalating risk, factoring in hazard warnings, susceptibility, and population density. | "Brgy. Del Rosario is now the #1 provincial hotspot due to sustained rainfall and high flood susceptibility. PDRRMO attention recommended." |
| **Critical Facility Impact** | Projects which LGU-supplied critical facilities (hospitals, evacuation centers) are located within an active alert's impact footprint. | "Flood watch for Brgy. San Isidro directly impacts the local health center and two primary schools designated as evacuation centers. Recommend activating alternate sites." |

## 4. The Solution: A Phased Provincial Rollout
