# Project LINGKOD: Provincial Rollout Implementation Plan

**Date:** September 3, 2025
**Version:** 2.0 (Provincial Scope)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the strategic, three-phase implementation plan for the province-wide rollout of the **LINGKOD Emergency Command Platform** in Camarines Sur. This plan provides a clear roadmap for the full-scale deployment of the platform, moving from a validated pilot to a comprehensive, province-wide intelligence and early-warning system.

The objective is to systematically build, validate, and scale the platform's core modules—from the **Threat Analysis Engine** to the **Last-Mile Communication Hub**—to ensure maximum impact and a successful partnership with the Provincial Government.

The timeline and resource estimates are based on a project start date of **January 2026**.

## 2. Recommended Team Composition

The team structure is designed to scale with the project's phases. The core team will be consistent, with the potential to add specialists during the expansion and advanced capabilities phases.

*   **Project Manager (1):** Manages the overall program.
*   **Lead Backend Engineer (1):** Oversees technical architecture.
*   **Backend Engineer (2):** Develops services and APIs.
*   **Lead Frontend Engineer (1):** Oversees UI/UX development.
*   **Frontend Engineer (2):** Builds the user interfaces.
*   **QA Engineer (1):** Manages testing and quality assurance.
*   **Implementation & Training Specialist (1):** (Joins in Phase 2) Responsible for LGU onboarding and training.

## 3. Phase 1: Pilot Implementation & Validation

**Goal:** Deploy and validate the core Project LINGKOD system in a controlled, real-world environment with 3-4 high-risk, representative municipalities.
**Estimated Duration:** 5 Months
**Estimated Effort:** 48 Person-Weeks

### 3.1. Scope & Deliverables
*   **Core Platform Development:** Full implementation of the LINGKOD Emergency Command Platform, including the Data Ingestion, Threat Analysis Engine, Alert Management Dashboard, and Communication Hub modules.
*   **Phase 1 Insight Catalog Implementation:** Configuration and validation of the core predictive insights, including Barangay Flood and Landslide Watch, Quake Rapid Impact Estimation, and the Hotspot Escalation Score.
*   **Pilot LGU Onboarding:** Configuration and deployment of the platform for 3-4 selected high-risk municipalities, including ingestion of LGU-specific data (critical facilities, etc.).
*   **Operator Training:** Intensive, hands-on training for PDRRMO and pilot MDRRMOs on the full alert management lifecycle, from insight review to public dissemination.
*   **Pilot Validation Report:** A comprehensive report detailing system performance against KPIs, user feedback, and actionable recommendations for the full province-wide expansion.

## 5. Phase 3: Advanced Capabilities & Integration

**Goal:** Enhance the system with advanced features and full integration into the provincial ecosystem.
**Estimated Duration:** Varies by module
**Estimated Effort:** Billed per module.

### 5.1. Scope & Deliverables
This phase consists of optional, high-value modules that can be implemented based on the province's evolving needs.

### 5.2. Available Modules
