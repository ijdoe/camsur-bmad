# Security Architecture Specification

## 1. Introduction

This document details the security architecture for Project LINGKOD. The primary goal is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of the system and its data, adhering to industry best practices and relevant compliance standards.

## 2. Security Principles

- **Defense in Depth:** Security controls are layered at every level of the architecture.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Users and services are granted only the permissions necessary to perform their functions.
- **Secure by Design:** Security is a core consideration from the earliest stages of development, not an afterthought.
- **Zero Trust Architecture:** Never trust, always verify. All access requests are authenticated and authorized.

## 3. Authentication & Authorization

- **User Authentication:**
    - **Method:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with OAuth 2.0 Password Grant flow.
    - **Identity Provider:** The system's own User & Auth Service will act as the IdP.
    - **Password Policy:** Strong passwords enforced (minimum length, complexity). Passwords will be hashed using a strong, salted algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
- **Authorization:**
    - **Model:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
    - **Roles:** `Admin`, `Operator`, `Viewer`.
    - **Permissions:** Granular permissions will be associated with each role to control access to specific API endpoints and UI components.
- **API Authentication:**
    - External systems accessing the API will use API Keys or OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow.

## 4. Data Security

- **Encryption in Transit:**
    - All communication between clients, services, and databases will be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.
- **Encryption at Rest:**
    - All data stored in PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, and Elasticsearch will be encrypted at the storage level using managed cloud provider features (e.g., AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault).
- **Data Isolation:**
    - Multi-tenancy will be enforced at the application layer. All database queries will be scoped by the user's `lgu_id` to prevent data leakage between tenants.

## 5. Network Security

- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):** All services will be deployed within a private VPC.
- **Subnets:** Public subnets for internet-facing resources (API Gateway, Load Balancers) and private subnets for backend services and databases.
- **Security Groups / Firewalls:** Strict ingress and egress rules will be configured to only allow necessary traffic between services.
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF will be deployed in front of the API Gateway to protect against common web exploits (OWASP Top 10), such as SQL injection and XSS.

## 6. Application Security

- **Input Validation:** All incoming data from clients and external sources will be rigorously validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
- **Dependency Scanning:** Automated tools (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot) will be used to scan for vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
- **Static & Dynamic Analysis (SAST/DAST):** Code will be regularly scanned for security vulnerabilities.
- **Secrets Management:** All secrets (API keys, database credentials) will be stored securely in a secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault), not in code or configuration files.

## 7. Logging & Monitoring

- **Audit Trails:** All sensitive actions (e.g., alert approval, user creation, permission changes) will be logged with user context.
- **Security Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring of logs and metrics for suspicious activity using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Sentry.
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** An IDS will be configured to detect and alert on potential security breaches.

## 8. Compliance

- The system will be designed to be compliant with relevant data privacy and security regulations, such as the Data Privacy Act of the Philippines (RA 10173).

This document will be updated as the architecture evolves and more detailed security decisions are made.
