# Deployment Architecture

## 1. Overview

This document describes the deployment architecture for Project LINGKOD. The architecture is designed to be cloud-agnostic, scalable, and resilient, using containerization as the core technology.

## 2. Environments

We will maintain three primary environments:

- **Development:** Local developer machines using Docker Compose.
- **Staging:** A production-like environment in the cloud for testing and QA.
- **Production:** The live environment for end-users.

## 3. Containerization

- All backend services and the frontend application will be packaged as Docker images.
- Docker Compose will be used to orchestrate the application stack for local development.

## 4. Production Deployment (High-Level)

The production environment will be deployed on a major cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) and will consist of the following components:

- **Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes (e.g., EKS, AKS, GKE) will be used to manage and scale our containerized services.
- **API Gateway:** A managed API Gateway will route traffic to the appropriate backend services.
- **Load Balancers:** Load balancers will distribute traffic across multiple instances of our services.
- **Managed Databases:** We will use managed services for PostgreSQL (with PostGIS/TimescaleDB), Redis, and Elasticsearch to reduce operational overhead.
- **CDN:** A Content Delivery Network (CDN) will be used to serve frontend assets and cached API responses, improving performance and reducing latency.
- **CI/CD:** A CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) will be set up to automate the building, testing, and deployment of our applications.

## 5. MVP Deployment

For the initial MVP demonstration, a simpler deployment model may be used:

- A single virtual machine (VM) in the cloud.
- Docker Compose to run all services on the single VM.
- This approach is cost-effective for a demo but is not suitable for production.

## 6. Scalability & Resilience

- **Horizontal Scaling:** Kubernetes will allow us to scale services horizontally by adding more container instances.
- **Self-Healing:** Kubernetes will automatically restart services that fail.
- **Multi-AZ Deployment:** For high availability, services and databases will be deployed across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
