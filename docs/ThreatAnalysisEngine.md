# Threat Analysis Engine

## 1. Overview

The Threat Analysis Engine is the core component of Project LINGKOD. It is a data fusion and analysis engine that correlates data from multiple sources to generate predictive alerts for disaster management.

## 2. Data Sources

The engine ingests data from the following sources:

*   **Satellite Intelligence:** Daily, province-wide imagery from a commercial satellite provider.
*   **On-the-Ground AI:** Real-time alerts from AI-powered CCTV cameras at critical infrastructure points.
*   **IoT Network:** Real-time, hyper-local environmental data (rain, water levels) from a network of sensors.

## 3. Alert Generation

The engine uses a combination of machine learning models and rule-based algorithms to analyze the incoming data and identify potential threats. When a threat is detected, the engine generates a predictive alert that includes the following information:

*   **Threat Type:** The type of threat (e.g., flooding, landslide).
*   **Location:** The specific area at risk.
*   **Severity:** The severity of the threat (e.g., low, medium, high).
*   **Confidence:** The confidence level of the prediction.
*   **Timestamp:** The time the alert was generated.

## 4. Output

The engine's output is twofold:

1.  **Standalone Interface:** A rich visualization of all data streams and alerts is provided through the Coram.ai Emergency Management System (EMS).
2.  **Complementary Feed:** High-priority, actionable alerts are sent via a secure API to be ingested by existing city-level or third-party command center software.
