**Date:** August 30, 2025

**Story:** [Story 7.2.1: Implement Data Correlation Logic](docs/stories/story-7.2.1-implement-data-correlation-logic.md)
**Epic:** [Epic 7.2: Threat Analysis Engine](docs/epics/epic-7.2-threat-analysis-engine.md)

## 1. Overview

This risk assessment identifies potential issues and mitigation strategies for implementing the data correlation logic within the Threat Analysis Engine. This component is critical as it forms the basis for all subsequent threat detection.

## 2. Identified Risks

### 2.1. Technical Risk: Inaccurate Geospatial Correlation
- **Description:** The logic for correlating data points based on geospatial proximity might be inaccurate, leading to incorrect grouping of events or missed correlations.
- **Probability:** 3 (Moderate) - Geospatial calculations can be complex.
- **Impact:** 3 (High) - Incorrect correlations will lead to false alerts or missed real threats, severely impacting system credibility.
- **Score:** 9 (Critical)
- **Mitigation:**
    -   Thorough unit and integration testing of PostGIS queries and correlation algorithms.
    -   Use of established geospatial libraries and best practices.
    -   Early validation with diverse simulated data sets, including edge cases (e.g., sensors on administrative boundaries).
    -   Peer review of geospatial logic by an experienced developer.

### 2.2. Performance Risk: Slow Data Correlation
- **Description:** Correlating large volumes of time-series and geospatial data in real-time might lead to performance bottlenecks, exceeding the 5-second alert generation NFR.
- **Probability:** 3 (Moderate) - High data volume is expected.
- **Impact:** 2 (Medium) - Delays in alert generation reduce the system's proactive value.
- **Score:** 6 (Significant)
- **Mitigation:**
    -   Optimize database indexing for `timestamp` and `location` fields in `sensor_readings`, `cctv_alerts`, and `satellite_imagery`.
    -   Implement efficient data partitioning strategies (ee.g., TimescaleDB hypertables).
    -   Utilize Redis for caching frequently accessed geospatial data or lookup tables.
    -   Conduct early performance testing with simulated high-volume data.
    -   Consider asynchronous processing for less time-critical correlations.

### 2.3. Data Risk: Inconsistent Data Formats
- **Description:** Discrepancies or inconsistencies in the format of simulated data from different sources could break the correlation logic.
- **Probability:** 2 (Low) - We control the simulated data generation.
- **Impact:** 2 (Medium) - Requires rework of ingestion and correlation logic.
- **Score:** 4 (Moderate)
- **Mitigation:**
    -   Strict adherence to defined data models and schemas during mock data generation.
    -   Implement robust data validation at the Data Ingestion Service.
    -   Establish clear data contracts between the mock data generators and the Threat Analysis Engine.

### 2.4. Technical Risk: Complexity of Correlation Logic
- **Description:** The correlation logic might become overly complex and difficult to maintain or extend, especially with evolving rule packs and new data sources.
- **Probability:** 2 (Low) - Starting with a clear technical spec.
- **Impact:** 2 (Medium) - Increases development time and potential for bugs in the future.
- **Score:** 4 (Moderate)
- **Mitigation:**
    -   Modular design of the correlation component, separating concerns (e.g., data fetching, geospatial matching, time-based grouping).
    -   Comprehensive code documentation and clear comments.
    -   Regular code reviews.
    -   Prioritize simplicity and extensibility in initial design.

## 3. Risk Summary

The primary concern is **Inaccurate Geospatial Correlation (Score 9)**, which directly impacts the credibility and effectiveness of the entire LINGKOD system. Performance is also a significant consideration given the real-time nature of the platform.

## 4. Next Steps for QA

-   Prioritize test design (`*design`) for this story, focusing heavily on geospatial accuracy and performance.
-   Ensure comprehensive unit and integration tests cover all correlation scenarios, including edge cases.
-   Plan for early performance testing during development.
