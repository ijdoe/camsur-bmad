# Testing Strategy

## 1. Overview

This document defines the testing strategy for Project LINGKOD, ensuring a high-quality, reliable, and performant application. We will follow a multi-layered testing approach, integrating testing into every stage of the development lifecycle.

## 2. Testing Levels

### 2.1. Unit Testing

- **Goal:** To test individual components and functions in isolation.
- **Scope:** All critical business logic, UI components, and utility functions.
- **Tools:** Jest, React Testing Library.
- **Target:** >80% code coverage.

### 2.2. Integration Testing

- **Goal:** To test the interaction between different components and services.
- **Scope:** API endpoints, service-to-service communication, database interactions.
- **Tools:** Supertest (for API testing), Jest.

### 2.3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

- **Goal:** To test complete user flows from the user's perspective.
- **Scope:** Critical user journeys, such as the Alert Approval Flow.
- **Tools:** Cypress or Playwright.

### 2.4. Performance Testing

- **Goal:** To ensure the system meets its performance and scalability requirements.
- **Scope:** High-volume data ingestion, API response times under load.
- **Tools:** k6, JMeter.

### 2.5. Security Testing

- **Goal:** To identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities.
- **Scope:** Penetration testing, dependency scanning, static/dynamic code analysis.
- **Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Snyk, Dependabot.

## 3. Testing in the CI/CD Pipeline

- **On Every Commit:** Unit tests and linting will be run.
- **On Pull Request:** All unit and integration tests must pass before merging.
- **On Merge to Staging:** E2E tests will be run against the staging environment.
- **Periodically:** Performance and security tests will be run against the staging environment.

## 4. Bug Triage & Management

- **Tool:** GitHub Issues.
- **Priority Levels:**
    - **P0 (Critical):** Blocks release, must be fixed immediately.
    - **P1 (High):** Major functionality impaired.
    - **P2 (Medium):** Minor functionality impaired or major cosmetic issue.
    - **P3 (Low):** Minor cosmetic issue.
- **Triage Process:** A weekly bug triage meeting will be held to prioritize and assign issues.
