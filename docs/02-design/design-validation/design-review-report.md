# Design Review Report

## 1. Overview

**Date:** 2025-08-30

This report documents the internal review of the design specifications for Project LINGKOD, including the Design System, Mockup Descriptions, and Prototype Specifications. The goal is to ensure these designs are complete, consistent, and ready for the formal Design Gate review.

## 2. Review Checklist

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Design System Specification** | | |
| Is the color palette complete and accessible? | **COMPLETE** | Contrast ratios should be checked during implementation. |
| Is the typography scale clear and sufficient? | **COMPLETE** | |
| Is the spacing system well-defined? | **COMPLETE** | |
| Are the component specifications clear? | **COMPLETE** | |
| **Mockup Descriptions** | | |
| Does the Login screen mockup meet requirements? | **COMPLETE** | |
| Does the Dashboard mockup meet requirements? | **COMPLETE** | |
| Are all necessary states (default, error, loading) defined? | **COMPLETE** | |
| **Prototype Specification** | | |
| Is the Alert Approval user flow clear and logical? | **COMPLETE** | |
| Are all screen transitions and interactions defined? | **COMPLETE** | |

## 3. Findings & Recommendations

- **Finding:** The design documentation is currently textual. While detailed, it lacks visual representation.
- **Recommendation:** Generate visual mockups (e.g., using a design tool like Figma or creating HTML/CSS prototypes) before the formal stakeholder review.

- **Finding:** The component specifications are individual files.
- **Recommendation:** Create a central component library (e.g., using Storybook) during implementation to serve as a live, interactive version of these specifications.

- **Finding:** Accessibility guidelines are defined but not yet tested.
- **Recommendation:** Conduct automated and manual accessibility testing during the implementation of the component library.

## 4. Next Steps

1.  Proceed with creating the Design System Implementation Plan.
2.  Schedule a formal Design Gate review with all stakeholders.
3.  Prepare to present the design specifications and address the need for visual mockups during the review.

## 5. Preliminary Approval

This internal review concludes that the design documentation is sufficient to proceed to the next planning step.
