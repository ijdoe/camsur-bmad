## 4. Review Findings & Discussion

This section will be populated during the gate review meeting.

| Topic | Finding / Comment | Action Item | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Scalability** | The microservices architecture is well-suited for scalability. The use of a message queue is a key strength. | Define initial scaling policies for Kubernetes HPA. | Dev Lead |
| **Security** | The security plan is comprehensive. RBAC model needs detailed role definitions. | Document specific permissions for 'Admin', 'Operator', and 'Viewer' roles. | Product Manager |
| **Data Model** | The data models are well-defined. The TimescaleDB incompatibility with PostgreSQL 14 is a known risk. | Confirm cloud provider's PostgreSQL version support. Develop a contingency plan if v15+ is not available. | Lead Architect |
| **Frontend** | The frontend tech stack is modern and robust. The plan for a shared component library is good. | Create initial Storybook setup and component stubs. | Dev Lead |
| **DevOps** | The CI/CD and IaC plans are solid. | Set up initial GitHub Actions workflow for the backend service. | Dev Lead |
