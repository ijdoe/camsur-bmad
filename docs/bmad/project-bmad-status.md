- **Design:** Key visual design and UI deliverables were skipped and must be completed before proceeding.

**Action:** The project is being reset to the **Design Gate** to ensure BMAD compliance.

## 2. Phase Gate Status

### Phase 1: Requirements
- **Status:** **PARTIALLY COMPLETE**
- **Gate:** **NOT PASSED**
- **Gaps:**
    - Missing formal stakeholder sign-off.
    - `stakeholder-requirements.md` and `business-case.md` need to be formally created from existing documents.

### Phase 2: Design
- **Status:** **INCOMPLETE**
- **Gate:** **BLOCKED**
- **Gaps:**
    - **CRITICAL:** No high-fidelity visual mockups.
    - **CRITICAL:** No formal design system specification.
    - No interactive prototypes.
    - No usability testing plan.

### Phase 3: Architecture
- **Status:** **PARTIALLY COMPLETE**
- **Gate:** **NOT PASSED**
- **Gaps:**
    - Architecture documents need to be restructured.
    - Missing formal ADRs.
    - Missing security and performance architecture documents.

### Phase 4: Implementation
- **Status:** **PREMATURELY STARTED**
- **Gate:** **BLOCKED**
- **Notes:** Backend implementation is advanced, but frontend is blocked by the incomplete Design phase.

## 3. Immediate Action Plan

1.  **Halt new development.**
2.  **Execute the BMAD Compliance Plan** dated 2025-08-30.
3.  **Complete all Phase 1 (Requirements) deliverables** and hold a formal gate review.
