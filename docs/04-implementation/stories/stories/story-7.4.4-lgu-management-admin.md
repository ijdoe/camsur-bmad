## Description
As an administrator, I want to manage LGU configurations, including their specific rule packs and communication settings, so that the system is tailored to each client and can support multi-tenancy.

## Functional Requirements
- **FR 5.5.5:** The dashboard shall support LGU management (CRUD for Admin role), including configuration of rule packs and communication settings.
- **FR 5.7.3:** The system shall support multi-tenancy with strict data isolation between LGUs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **GIVEN** an administrator is logged into the Admin/Operator Dashboard
- **WHEN** the administrator navigates to the LGU Management section
- **THEN** a list of all configured LGUs shall be displayed.
- **AND** the administrator shall be able to create new LGU entries, defining their name, region, province, and city/municipality.
- **AND** the administrator shall be able to update LGU-specific configurations, such as alert thresholds, rule packs (e.g., YAML/JSON), and communication templates.
- **AND** the administrator shall be able to delete LGU entries.
- **AND** changes to LGU configurations shall be immediately reflected in the system's behavior for that LGU.

## Technical Notes
- Implement frontend components for LGU listing, creation, editing, and deletion.
- Integrate with a backend service (e.g., User & Authentication Service or a dedicated LGU Service) for CRUD operations on the `lgus` data model.
- Ensure LGU configurations are stored in the `lgus.configuration` JSONB field or a dedicated configuration table.
- Implement logic to dynamically load LGU-specific rule packs and communication templates based on the active LGU context.
- Enforce strict data isolation to ensure one LGU's data/configuration does not affect another.
