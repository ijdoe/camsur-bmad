## Description
As a sales representative, I want the MVP's UI/UX to be highly polished, intuitive, and visually appealing so that it creates a strong, professional impression during client demonstrations and effectively communicates the product's value.

## Functional Requirements
- **NFR 6.6.1:** The Admin/Operator Dashboard shall be intuitive and easy to navigate for new users.
- **NFR 6.6.2:** The UI shall be responsive and visually appealing across different screen sizes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **GIVEN** the MVP is being demonstrated to a potential client
- **WHEN** the sales representative navigates through the dashboard and interacts with its components
- **THEN** the UI shall be visually consistent with the defined Visual Design System (from UX Spec).
- **AND** all interactive elements shall be intuitive and responsive.
- **AND** the overall user experience shall be smooth, professional, and free of visual glitches or performance issues.
- **AND** the dashboard shall be responsive and display correctly on various screen sizes (e.g., large monitors, laptops).

## Technical Notes
