# Story 7.3.1: Real-time Alert List Display

## Epic
[Epic 7.3: Alert Management & Workflow](docs/epics/epic-7.3-alert-management-workflow.md)

## Description
As an operator, I want to see a real-time list of all generated alerts in the Admin/Operator Dashboard so I can quickly identify new threats and monitor the overall situation.

## Functional Requirements
- **FR 5.3.1:** The system shall display a real-time list of generated `system_alerts` in the Admin/Operator Dashboard.
- **FR 5.5.3:** The dashboard shall include filterable and sortable lists/tables of `system_alerts`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **GIVEN** the operator is logged into the Admin/Operator Dashboard
- **WHEN** new `system_alerts` are generated by the Threat Analysis Engine
- **THEN** the alert list/table in the dashboard shall update in real-time to display the new alerts.
- **AND** the alert list shall display key information such as ID, timestamp, affected area, severity, and status.
- **AND** the operator shall be able to filter and sort the alert list by various criteria (e.g., status, severity, time).

## Technical Notes
- Implement WebSocket integration in the frontend to receive real-time alert updates from the backend.
- Use a state management library (e.g., Zustand, TanStack Query) to manage the alert list data.
- Implement filtering and sorting logic in the frontend, potentially with backend API support for complex queries.
- Ensure the UI provides clear visual cues for new or updated alerts.
