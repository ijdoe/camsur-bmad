# Project LINGKOD: Feature Roadmap

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the phased feature roadmap for Project LINGKOD, building upon the foundation of the MVP. The roadmap is designed to incrementally enhance the platform's capabilities, moving from a robust demonstration tool to a comprehensive, market-leading disaster response and management system.

## 2. Phase 1: MVP (Current Scope)

The focus of the MVP is to deliver a compelling sales demonstration that showcases the core value proposition of the "Insight-Driven" approach.

- **Core Insight Generation:** Implement the initial "Insight Catalog" with a focus on hydro-meteorological hazards (flooding, landslides).
- **Operator Dashboard:** Develop the primary dashboard with the interactive map, priority queue, and insight review workflow.
- **Dual-Mode Functionality:** Ensure the system can operate in both "Standalone" and "Complementary" modes.
- **Simulation Environment:** Build a robust simulation environment for creating realistic demo scenarios.

## 3. Phase 2: Community Intelligence & Enhanced Situational Awareness

This phase focuses on integrating community-sourced data and enhancing the platform's analytical capabilities.

- **Community Intelligence Module (CIM):**
    - Develop a dedicated service for ingesting multi-lingual voice and text reports from citizens.
    - Implement NLP models for automatic categorization, sentiment analysis, and entity extraction.
    - Integrate the CIM feed into the operator dashboard.
- **Dynamic Insight Briefing Dashboard:**
    - Evolve the dashboard into a configurable, widget-based interface.
    - Allow operators to create and save custom briefing layouts.
    - Develop a library of widgets for `Situational Overview`, `Critical Observations`, `Street-Level Hotspots`, `Predictive Risk Outlook`, and `Strategic Recommendations`.
- **Logistics & Resource Management (Initial Implementation):**
    - Create a database of critical infrastructure and resources (evacuation centers, hospitals, rescue teams).
    - Implement basic resource tracking and status management.

## 4. Phase 3: Proactive Resource Management & Advanced Analytics

This phase focuses on moving from reactive alerting to proactive resource management and decision support.

- **Logistics & Resource Management (Advanced):**
    - Implement an AI-powered recommendation engine for resource allocation based on insight analysis.
    - Develop features for tracking relief distribution and managing supply chains.
- **Rapid Impact Analysis Module:**
    - Develop a module for ingesting and analyzing drone and satellite imagery for post-disaster damage assessment.
    - Implement computer vision models for automatic damage classification.
- **Advanced Predictive Analytics:**
    - Integrate machine learning models for more sophisticated threat prediction.
    - Develop "what-if" scenario modeling capabilities.

## 5. Future Vision: Integrated Public Safety Platform

The long-term vision for Project LINGKOD is to evolve into a fully integrated public safety platform that covers the entire disaster management lifecycle.

- **Public Information Portal:** A comprehensive public-facing portal with real-time alerts, safety information, and two-way communication features.
- **Integrated Emergency Services:** Seamless integration with police, fire, and medical services for a unified response.
- **Smart City Integration:** Integration with other smart city systems (e.g., traffic management, public utilities) for a holistic view of the urban environment.
