# Epic 7.6: Security & Multi-Tenancy

## Description
Implement robust authentication, authorization, and data isolation for multiple LGUs. This epic covers the backend services for user management, role-based access control, and ensuring strict data separation between different client organizations.

## Functional Requirements (from PRD)
- **FR 5.7.1:** The system shall provide JWT-based user authentication (login/logout).
- **FR 5.7.2:** The system shall implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for different user roles (Admin, Operator, Viewer).
- **FR 5.7.3:** The system shall support multi-tenancy with strict data isolation between LGUs.
- **FR 5.5.4:** The dashboard shall support user management (CRUD for Admin role).
- **FR 5.5.5:** The dashboard shall support LGU management (CRUD for Admin role), including configuration of rule packs and communication settings.

## Non-Functional Requirements (from PRD)
- **NFR 6.3.1:** Data shall be encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest.
- **NFR 6.3.2:** API endpoints shall be protected with rate limiting and input validation.
- **NFR 6.3.3:** The system shall protect against common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).

## Technical Specifications (from Technical Specification)
- **Backend Service:** User & Authentication Service
    - **Endpoints:** `POST /auth/login`, `POST /auth/register`, `GET /users/me`, `GET /users/:id`, `PUT /users/:id`
    - **Logic:** JWT generation and validation, password hashing, RBAC.
- **Data Models:** `users`, `lgus`
- **Security & Authentication Section:** JWT-based authentication with OAuth2.0, RBAC, data encryption, API security, multi-tenancy.
- **Multi-Region Configuration Section:** LGU-specific settings, tenant isolation.

## User Stories (To be defined)
- As a user, I want to securely log in to the system using my credentials.
- As an administrator, I want to create and manage user accounts with different roles (Admin, Operator, Viewer).
- As an administrator, I want to manage LGU configurations, including their specific rule packs and communication settings.
- As an operator, I want to only see data and alerts relevant to my assigned LGU.
- As a developer, I want to ensure all API endpoints are secured with authentication and authorization.
- As a developer, I want to ensure sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
