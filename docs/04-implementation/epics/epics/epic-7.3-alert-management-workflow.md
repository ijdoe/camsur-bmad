# Epic 7.3: Alert Management & Workflow

## Description
Implement the full lifecycle of alerts, from generation to operator approval and audit. This epic covers the backend services for managing alert states and operator actions, as well as the frontend components for displaying and interacting with alerts.

## Functional Requirements (from PRD)
- **FR 5.3.1:** The system shall display a real-time list of generated `system_alerts` in the Admin/Operator Dashboard.
- **FR 5.3.2:** The system shall allow operators to view detailed information for each alert, including an "evidence panel" of contributing data.
- **FR 5.3.3:** The system shall provide an operator workflow for approving, editing, or rescinding alerts.
- **FR 5.3.4:** The system shall maintain an audit trail of all operator actions on alerts.
- **FR 5.3.5:** The system shall allow operators to adjust alert geometry (GeoJSON polygon) and add notes.

## Technical Specifications (from Technical Specification)
- **Backend Service:** Alert Management Service
    - **Endpoints:** `GET /alerts`, `GET /alerts/:id`, `POST /alerts/:id/approve`, `POST /alerts/:id/rescind`, `PUT /alerts/:id`
    - **Logic:** Handles state transitions, audit logging, and operator actions.
- **Data Models:** `system_alerts` (managed by this service).
- **Frontend Components (from UX Spec):** Alert List/Table, Alert Detail Panel (with Evidence Panel, Communication Preview, Action Buttons).

## User Stories (To be defined)
- As an operator, I want to see a real-time list of all generated alerts so I can quickly identify new threats.
- As an operator, I want to view detailed information for a selected alert, including all contributing data, so I can make an informed decision.
- As an operator, I want to approve an alert so that it can be disseminated to affected communities.
- As an operator, I want to rescind an alert if it is no longer valid or was a false alarm.
- As an operator, I want to add notes and adjust the affected area of an alert so that the information is accurate and complete.
- As an administrator, I want to view an audit trail of all operator actions on alerts so that I can ensure accountability.
