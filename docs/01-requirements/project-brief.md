# Project Brief: CamSur Provincial Situational Awareness Platform

## 1. Project Goal

To develop and propose a single, high-impact, technology-driven solution for Camarines Sur that transforms raw disaster data into actionable, predictive insights. The primary focus is on empowering provincial leadership and disaster managers with the intelligence needed to anticipate threats and act decisively, enhancing disaster resilience and response capabilities.

## 2. Core Problem

Initial proposals for broad AI integration were misaligned with the on-the-ground realities of the province, particularly the digital divide and the need for practical, low-tech communication channels. The core challenge is to leverage advanced technology (AI, IoT, Satellite Imagery) in a way that empowers and enhances existing, trusted systems, rather than replacing them.

## 3. Strategic Pivot

Following direct feedback from Governor Villafuerte, the project has pivoted from a wide-ranging AI governance framework to a focused disaster management platform named **"Project LINGKOD."**

## 4. Key Stakeholders

*   **Primary Beneficiary:** The citizens of Camarines Sur.
*   **Primary Client:** The Office of Governor Luis Ray Villafuerte.
*   **Implementing Body:** Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (PDRRMO).
*   **Technology Partners:** Synthesiq Technologies, Coram.ai, DMA-BD, and a selected satellite imagery provider.

## 5. Scope

The project involves the development and proposal of the "Project LINGKOD" platform, which integrates satellite data, AI-powered CCTV analysis, and on-the-ground IoT sensors to provide a comprehensive situational awareness dashboard. The core innovation is the **Threat Analysis Engine**, which fuses this data into predictive, barangay-level insights rather than just aggregating information. A key component is the "last-mile" communication system that disseminates clear, actionable alerts via SMS, radio, and to barangay officials. The initial phase will be a pilot program in select municipalities, demonstrating the platform's ability to generate meaningful intelligence from public data sources.

## 6. Intellectual Property and Commercialization Strategy

While the pilot is focused on Camarines Sur, the system is being designed for broader commercial application. The intellectual property (IP) is structured as follows:

*   **Partner IP:** The solution integrates licensed components from technology partners, including the Coram.ai EMS, the DMA-BD IoT network, and satellite imagery. These components remain the IP of their respective owners.
*   **Core Proprietary IP:** The primary intellectual property of Synthesiq Technologies is the **`ThreatAnalysisEngine`**. This includes the custom code, data fusion algorithms, and the unique rule-based logic that generates predictive alerts. The documented system workflow itself is also a key component of this proprietary IP.

*   **Commercialization Model:** The long-term vision is to offer the `ThreatAnalysisEngine` as a productized **"Intelligence Engine as a Service."** This service can be sold to other cities and organizations, integrating with their existing sensor systems and command center software to provide high-value, predictive analytics. This model allows for a scalable and repeatable revenue stream beyond the initial pilot project.
