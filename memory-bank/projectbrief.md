# Project Brief: CamSur Provincial Situational Awareness Platform

## 1. Project Goal

To develop and propose a single, high-impact, technology-driven solution for Camarines Sur that directly addresses the practical needs of its citizens and leadership. The primary focus is on enhancing provincial disaster resilience and response capabilities.

## 2. Core Problem

Initial proposals for broad AI integration were misaligned with the on-the-ground realities of the province, particularly the digital divide and the need for practical, low-tech communication channels. The core challenge is to leverage advanced technology (AI, IoT, Satellite Imagery) in a way that empowers and enhances existing, trusted systems, rather than replacing them.

## 3. Strategic Pivot

Following direct feedback from Governor Villafuerte, the project has pivoted from a wide-ranging AI governance framework to a focused disaster management platform named **"Project LINGKOD."**

## 4. Key Stakeholders

*   **Primary Beneficiary:** The citizens of Camarines Sur.
*   **Primary Client:** The Office of Governor Luis Ray Villafuerte.
*   **Implementing Body:** Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (PDRRMO).
*   **Technology Partners:** Synthesiq Technologies, Coram.ai, DMA-BD, and a selected satellite imagery provider.

## 5. Scope

The project involves the development and proposal of the "Project LINGKOD" platform, which integrates satellite data, AI-powered CCTV analysis, and on-the-ground IoT sensors to provide a comprehensive situational awareness dashboard. A key component is the "last-mile" communication system that disseminates clear, actionable alerts via SMS, radio, and to barangay officials. The initial phase will be a pilot program in select municipalities.
