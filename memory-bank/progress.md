# Project Progress: From Concept to Final Proposal

## 1. What Works

*   **Core Concept:** The "Project LINGKOD" concept is solid. It is well-aligned with stakeholder feedback, leverages partner strengths, and addresses a critical, high-impact problem.
*   **Proposal Document:** A comprehensive and persuasive proposal document has been drafted, incorporating a strong narrative element.
*   **Partnership Synergy:** The integrated model, combining satellite, AI CCTV, and IoT data, is a technically sound and powerful vision.
*   **Initial Technical Scope:** A foundational technical scope document (`docs/Pilot_Technical_Scope.md`) has been created, defining the data schemas, API structures, and initial rules for the pilot program.
*   **Detailed System Workflow:** A comprehensive workflow document (`docs/System_Workflow.md`), complete with a visual diagram, is in place to guide the development of the core `ThreatAnalysisEngine`.
*   **Communication Templates:** A foundational set of templates for SMS, radio, and official alerts (`docs/Communication_Templates.md`) has been drafted to guide the last-mile communication strategy.
*   **Expanded Technical Scope:** `docs/Pilot_Technical_Scope.md` now includes Trust & Assurance Framework, Governance & Advisory Board, Validation & Acceptance Plan, Human-in-the-Loop Workflow, Data/Model Governance, KPIs/SLAs, Shadow Mode Plan, and CAP/GeoJSON Interface Spec.
*   **Workflow Governance:** `docs/System_Workflow.md` updated with Operator Review & Approval, audit trail, feedback loop to rule packs, governance notes, and standards/CAP-GeoJSON traceability.
*   **Template Metadata:** `docs/Communication_Templates.md` enriched with operator metadata, CAP/GeoJSON references, and approval headers/footers.
*   **Sales Enablement:** Created `docs/Why_Trust_Us.md` one-pager for executive trust framing.

## 2. What's Left to Build (MVP for Sales Demo)

*   **Core ThreatAnalysisEngine:** Implement the rule-based logic and data correlation mechanisms.
*   **Multi-Region Data Simulation Layer:** Develop a robust data generator for various regions and hazard scenarios.
*   **Interactive Dashboard Interface:** Build the Admin/Operator Dashboard with maps, real-time data, and operator workflow.
*   **API Endpoints for External Integration:** Develop GeoJSON and CAP 1.2 alert endpoints with authentication.
*   **Multi-Region Demo Scenarios:** Create specific demo scripts and data configurations for CamSur, Metro Manila, and other provinces.
*   **Enterprise-Grade Authentication and Multi-Tenancy:** Implement JWT-based authentication, RBAC, and data isolation.
*   **Testing and Polishing:** Conduct thorough testing, performance tuning, and UI/UX refinement for sales demonstrations.
*   **RFP/Development Team Selection Criteria:** Prepare documentation to aid in selecting a development partner.

## 3. Current Status

*   **Phase:** MVP Technical Specification Complete, Development Planning.
*   **Next Milestone:** Begin MVP development, focusing on the core ThreatAnalysisEngine and data simulation.

## 4. Evolution of Project Decisions

1.  **Initial Idea (Pre-Feedback):** A broad, ambitious "AI Governance Framework" covering multiple provincial sectors.
    *   *Decision:* Shelved due to feedback highlighting a disconnect with on-the-ground realities and the digital divide.

2.  **First Pivot ("AGRI-SIGURADO"):** A focused agricultural intelligence and disaster alert system.
    *   *Decision:* Invalidated due to a critical misunderstanding of a key partner's (Coram.ai) capabilities.

3.  **Second Pivot ("Project LINGKOD"):** A hyper-focused disaster resilience and situational awareness platform.
    *   *Decision:* Adopted as the final proposal direction. This concept is robust as it aligns perfectly with partner strengths (Coram.ai's security focus) and stakeholder needs.

4.  **Enhancement (Multi-Layered Intelligence):** The decision to re-integrate satellite imagery from a new, dedicated provider.
    *   *Decision:* Incorporated into the "LINGKOD" proposal to create a more comprehensive and powerful solution, combining macro and micro views.

5.  **Strategic Shift to Sales MVP:** The project focus has shifted from immediate pilot implementation to developing a robust MVP for sales demonstrations, recognizing the need to secure contracts before further development. This led to the creation of a detailed technical specification for the MVP.
