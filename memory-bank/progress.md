# Project Progress: From Concept to Final Proposal

## 1. What Works

*   **Core Concept:** The "Project LINGKOD" concept is solid. It is well-aligned with stakeholder feedback, leverages partner strengths, and addresses a critical, high-impact problem.
*   **Proposal Document:** A comprehensive and persuasive proposal document has been drafted, incorporating a strong narrative element.
*   **Partnership Synergy:** The integrated model, combining satellite, AI CCTV, and IoT data, is a technically sound and powerful vision.
*   **Initial Technical Scope:** A foundational technical scope document (`docs/Pilot_Technical_Scope.md`) has been created, defining the data schemas, API structures, and initial rules for the pilot program.
*   **Detailed System Workflow:** A comprehensive workflow document (`docs/System_Workflow.md`), complete with a visual diagram, is in place to guide the development of the core `ThreatAnalysisEngine`.
*   **Communication Templates:** A foundational set of templates for SMS, radio, and official alerts (`docs/Communication_Templates.md`) has been drafted to guide the last-mile communication strategy.
*   **Expanded Technical Scope:** `docs/Pilot_Technical_Scope.md` now includes Trust & Assurance Framework, Governance & Advisory Board, Validation & Acceptance Plan, Human-in-the-Loop Workflow, Data/Model Governance, KPIs/SLAs, Shadow Mode Plan, and CAP/GeoJSON Interface Spec.
*   **Workflow Governance:** `docs/System_Workflow.md` updated with Operator Review & Approval, audit trail, feedback loop to rule packs, governance notes, and standards/CAP-GeoJSON traceability.
*   **Template Metadata:** `docs/Communication_Templates.md` enriched with operator metadata, CAP/GeoJSON references, and approval headers/footers.
*   **Sales Enablement:** Created `docs/Why_Trust_Us.md` one-pager for executive trust framing.
*   **MVP Technical Specification:** A detailed technical specification (`docs/Project_LINGKOD_MVP_Technical_Specification.md`) has been created, aligning with UX and PRD.
*   **PRD, UX Spec, Architecture Alignment:** Core planning documents are now aligned.
*   **BMAD Planning Artifacts:** `docs/epics/` and `docs/stories/` directories created and populated with detailed epics and user stories.
*   **QA Framework Established:** `docs/qa/assessments/` and `docs/qa/gates/` directories created, and initial risk profile and test design for a critical story completed.
*   **Development Environment Setup:** Backend (NestJS) and Frontend (Next.js) projects initialized, and all core dependencies installed. Database schema (`database/schema.sql`) created.
*   **Data Ingestion & Simulation Epic (7.1) Implemented:** Mock data generation, ingestion endpoints, and database storage for IoT, CCTV, and Satellite data are functional.
*   **Threat Analysis Engine Epic (7.2) Implemented:** Core logic for data correlation, rule pack loading, rule evaluation, alert generation, and versioning/traceability is functional.
*   **Alert Management & Workflow Epic (7.3) Implemented:** All backend services and controller endpoints for alert lifecycle management (list, view, approve, rescind, update) are functional, including TypeORM repository integration and DTOs.
*   **Interactive Dashboard Interface Epic (7.4) - Core Map Component Implemented:** Basic dashboard layout and the interactive map component with placeholder data for LGU boundaries, sensor locations, and active alerts are functional.
*   **Communication & Dissemination Epic (7.5) Implemented:** All backend services and controller endpoints for generating localized SMS, radio scripts, and official barangay alerts are functional, including TypeORM repository integration and DTOs.
*   **Frontend Stability Achieved:** Resolved persistent frontend compilation errors by strategically downgrading Next.js to `14.2.3` and React to `18.2.0`. This addressed critical compatibility issues with `react-map-gl` and other dependencies, stabilizing the development environment.
*   **End-to-End Login Flow Implemented (Epic 7.6):** Successfully implemented the complete user authentication flow. This includes a functional login page, backend integration, JWT handling, and protected routes for the dashboard.
*   **Login Flow Stability:** Resolved a series of critical bugs that were preventing users from logging in, including port conflicts, database connection errors, and incorrect role display. The login system is now stable and functional.
*   **BMAD Compliance Achieved:** Successfully executed a comprehensive plan to align the project with the BMAD methodology. All process and project documentation has been created and reorganized into a BMAD-compliant structure.
*   **Requirements Gate Passed:** All deliverables for the Requirements Gate have been completed and formally reviewed. The project has successfully passed the Requirements Gate with sign-off from all stakeholders.
*   **Design Gate Passed:** All design deliverables including UX specifications, design system, mockups, and prototypes have been reviewed and approved. The project has successfully passed the Design Gate.
*   **Architecture Gate Passed:** All architecture deliverables have been completed and formally reviewed. The project has successfully passed the Architecture Gate.
*   **Proposal Documents Enhanced:** In response to partner feedback, significantly enhanced the proposal package to focus on platform functionalities and value beyond costing:
    *   **Added Insight Catalog:** Created a detailed Phase 1 Insight Catalog demonstrating actionable, predictive insights (Flood Watch, Landslide Watch, Quake Impact, etc.) rather than just data aggregation.
    *   **Created Executive Brief:** Developed a one-page executive brief for the governor, summarizing the vision, key outcomes, and deliverables.
    *   **Deliverables-to-Investment Map:** Added clear mapping of investment to tangible deliverables for transparency.
    *   **Aligned All Documents:** Updated rollout plan and sales enablement with consistent messaging and a narrative-driven demo script.
*   **Phase 1 Implementation Plan Finalized:** Established a no-MoU approach for Phase 1, leveraging public data sources (PAGASA, PHIVOLCS, NAMRIA, MGB, PSA) to deliver a strong MVP with adapters, rules, and UI for insight generation.
*   **Document Alignment for Insight-Driven Narrative:** Updated all foundational project documents to align with the new insight-driven approach:
    *   **Project Brief:** Reframed the core goal to emphasize transforming raw data into actionable, predictive insights.
    *   **Product Requirements Document:** Added formal "Insight Generation & Management" section with the Phase 1 Insight Catalog.
    *   **UX Specification:** Updated workflows and UI components to focus on "Insight Cards," "Priority Queue," and "Evidence Panel."
    *   **Epic 7.2:** Renamed to "Insight Generation Engine" and updated user stories to focus on building specific insights from the catalog.
*   **Semantic Button Hierarchy Implemented:** Based on user feedback, a clear visual hierarchy for buttons was established. This involved creating a new semantic color palette, refactoring the `Button` component with `primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary`, and `destructive-outline` variants, and applying these variants to ensure actions are intuitive and clearly distinguishable in both light and dark modes.
*   **UI Component Library Implemented:** The core UI component library has been implemented based on a thorough UX audit and detailed specifications. This provides a solid, consistent, and accessible foundation for all future frontend development.
*   **UI Polish Pass for Demo:** Completed a UI polish pass to enhance the visual quality of the dashboard for client demonstrations. This included fixing icon sizing inconsistencies and improving layout clarity.
*   **Interactive Map Integrated:** The interactive map is now fully integrated and functional, displaying dynamic data for sensors and insights with interactive pop-up panels.

## 2. What's Left to Build (MVP for Sales Demo)

*   **Design QA in Storybook:** Conduct a thorough review of the implemented components in Storybook to ensure they perfectly match the UX specifications. **(Environment Ready)**
*   **Resume Feature Development:** Continue with the remaining epics in a BMAD-compliant manner. **(In Progress)**
    *   Implemented the core dashboard page, integrating all major UI components.
    *   Established a data fetching layer using `react-query` and created mock API endpoints to populate the dashboard with real-time data.

## 3. Current Status

*   **Phase:** Implementation.
*   **Next Milestone:** Resume Feature Development.
*   **Known Issues:** TimescaleDB incompatibility with PostgreSQL 14 remains an open issue to be addressed in the implementation phase.

## 4. Evolution of Project Decisions

1.  **Initial Idea (Pre-Feedback):** A broad, ambitious "AI Governance Framework" covering multiple provincial sectors.
    *   *Decision:* Shelved due to feedback highlighting a disconnect with on-the-ground realities and the digital divide.

2.  **First Pivot ("AGRI-SIGURADO"):** A focused agricultural intelligence and disaster alert system.
    *   *Decision:* Invalidated due to a critical misunderstanding of a key partner's (Coram.ai) capabilities.

3.  **Second Pivot ("Project LINGKOD"):** A hyper-focused disaster resilience and situational awareness platform.
    *   *Decision:* Adopted as the final proposal direction. This concept is robust as it aligns perfectly with partner strengths (Coram.ai's security focus) and stakeholder needs.

4.  **Enhancement (Multi-Layered Intelligence):** The decision to re-integrate satellite imagery from a new, dedicated provider.
    *   *Decision:* Incorporated into the "LINGKOD" proposal to create a more comprehensive and powerful solution, combining macro and micro views.

5.  **Strategic Shift to Sales MVP:** The project focus has shifted from immediate pilot implementation to developing a robust MVP for sales demonstrations, recognizing the need to secure contracts before further development. This led to the creation of a detailed technical specification for the MVP.
