# Project Progress: From Concept to Final Proposal

## 1. What Works

*   **Core Concept:** The "Project LINGKOD" concept is solid. It is well-aligned with stakeholder feedback, leverages partner strengths, and addresses a critical, high-impact problem.
*   **Proposal Document:** A comprehensive and persuasive proposal document has been drafted, incorporating a strong narrative element.
*   **Partnership Synergy:** The integrated model, combining satellite, AI CCTV, and IoT data, is a technically sound and powerful vision.
*   **Initial Technical Scope:** A foundational technical scope document (`docs/Pilot_Technical_Scope.md`) has been created, defining the data schemas, API structures, and initial rules for the pilot program.
*   **Detailed System Workflow:** A comprehensive workflow document (`docs/System_Workflow.md`), complete with a visual diagram, is in place to guide the development of the core `ThreatAnalysisEngine`.
*   **Communication Templates:** A foundational set of templates for SMS, radio, and official alerts (`docs/Communication_Templates.md`) has been drafted to guide the last-mile communication strategy.
*   **Expanded Technical Scope:** `docs/Pilot_Technical_Scope.md` now includes Trust & Assurance Framework, Governance & Advisory Board, Validation & Acceptance Plan, Human-in-the-Loop Workflow, Data/Model Governance, KPIs/SLAs, Shadow Mode Plan, and CAP/GeoJSON Interface Spec.
*   **Workflow Governance:** `docs/System_Workflow.md` updated with Operator Review & Approval, audit trail, feedback loop to rule packs, governance notes, and standards/CAP-GeoJSON traceability.
*   **Template Metadata:** `docs/Communication_Templates.md` enriched with operator metadata, CAP/GeoJSON references, and approval headers/footers.
*   **Sales Enablement:** Created `docs/Why_Trust_Us.md` one-pager for executive trust framing.

## 2. What's Left to Build

*   **The Pilot Platform:** The core `ThreatAnalysisEngine` and data integration components need to be developed.
*   **Formal Partnerships:** Formal agreements with technology partners need to be finalized and signed.
*   **Advisory Board:** Confirm PAGASA liaison, local hydrology/DRRM expert, and PDRRMO ops lead; establish cadence and change control.
*   **Validation Execution:** Historical backtesting (Phase 0) and Shadow Mode (Phase 1) with KPI tracking and acceptance gates.
*   **Interoperability Readiness:** Public endpoints for GeoJSON `/api/v1/alerts` and CAP `/api/v1/cap/{alertId}` with auth and rate limiting; ArcGIS consumption test.
*   **Capacity Building:** Training curriculum, tabletop and live drills, operator/governance runbooks.
*   **Monitoring & KPIs:** Dashboards for data freshness, ingestion lag, and pilot KPIs (lead time, precision/recall, delivery, operator latency).

## 3. Current Status

*   **Phase:** Pilot Program Scoping.
*   **Next Milestone:** Establish Advisory Board, ratify KPIs & acceptance gates, and secure formal partnership agreements.

## 4. Evolution of Project Decisions

1.  **Initial Idea (Pre-Feedback):** A broad, ambitious "AI Governance Framework" covering multiple provincial sectors.
    *   *Decision:* Shelved due to feedback highlighting a disconnect with on-the-ground realities and the digital divide.

2.  **First Pivot ("AGRI-SIGURADO"):** A focused agricultural intelligence and disaster alert system.
    *   *Decision:* Invalidated due to a critical misunderstanding of a key partner's (Coram.ai) capabilities.

3.  **Second Pivot ("Project LINGKOD"):** A hyper-focused disaster resilience and situational awareness platform.
    *   *Decision:* Adopted as the final proposal direction. This concept is robust as it aligns perfectly with partner strengths (Coram.ai's security focus) and stakeholder needs.

4.  **Enhancement (Multi-Layered Intelligence):** The decision to re-integrate satellite imagery from a new, dedicated provider.
    *   *Decision:* Incorporated into the "LINGKOD" proposal to create a more comprehensive and powerful solution, combining macro and micro views.
