# Product Context: Project LINGKOD

## 1. The Problem We Solve

During natural disasters, particularly typhoons, the flow of information is critical. While national agencies provide regional warnings, a significant "last-mile" gap exists. Communities on the ground lack hyper-local, timely, and actionable information that can mean the difference between safety and disaster.

The core problems are:
*   **Lack of Specificity:** Regional warnings don't identify which specific barangays are in the most immediate danger.
*   **Information Overload:** It's difficult for disaster managers to synthesize data from multiple sources (weather reports, field observations) in real-time.
*   **Communication Barriers:** Warnings often don't reach the most vulnerable citizens in a clear, understandable format through channels they trust and use.

## 2. How It Should Work

Project LINGKOD is designed as a flexible, dual-mode system. It can function as a **standalone central nervous system** for provincial disaster management, or as a **complementary intelligence engine** that enhances existing city-level command centers. It is a professional tool that powers a simple, effective public alert system.

The ideal user experience is one of seamless, proactive safety:

*   **For the PDRRMO Operator (Standalone Mode):** A single, clear dashboard that automatically flags critical threats. The system should remove the noise and present clear, data-driven recommendations for action, which they can then use to disseminate alerts directly.
*   **For the City Command Center Operator (Complementary Mode):** A critical, high-fidelity alert from LINGKOD appears directly within their existing software. The alert is specific and actionable (e.g., "Flash flood warning for Barangay San Roque"), allowing them to immediately activate their established response protocols without switching screens.
*   **For the Barangay Captain:** Receiving a direct, unambiguous SMS alert with specific instructions, empowering them to lead their community with confidence.
*   **For the Citizen:** Receiving a timely, easy-to-understand warning in their local dialect via SMS or radio, giving them enough time to secure their property, livestock, and family.

## 3. User Experience Goals

*   **Clarity:** The system must translate complex data into simple, actionable instructions.
*   **Credibility:** The alerts must be accurate and hyper-local to build trust.
*   **Accessibility:** The system must use low-tech, ubiquitous channels (SMS, radio) to ensure 100% reach in its standalone mode.
*   **Interoperability:** The system must be able to seamlessly feed its alerts into third-party systems with a clean, reliable API.
*   **Efficiency:** The system should reduce the cognitive load on disaster managers, allowing them to focus on decision-making, not data analysis.
