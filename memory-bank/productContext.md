# Product Context: Project LINGKOD

## 1. The Problem We Solve

During natural disasters, particularly typhoons, the flow of information is critical. While national agencies provide regional warnings, a significant "last-mile" gap exists. Communities on the ground lack hyper-local, timely, and actionable information that can mean the difference between safety and disaster.

The core problems are:
*   **Lack of Specificity:** Regional warnings don't identify which specific barangays are in the most immediate danger.
*   **Information Overload:** It's difficult for disaster managers to synthesize data from multiple sources (weather reports, field observations) in real-time.
*   **Communication Barriers:** Warnings often don't reach the most vulnerable citizens in a clear, understandable format through channels they trust and use.

## 2. How It Should Work

Project LINGKOD should function as a central nervous system for provincial disaster management. It is not a public-facing app. It is a professional tool for the PDRRMO that powers a simple, effective public alert system.

The ideal user experience is one of seamless, proactive safety:
*   **For the PDRRMO Operator:** A single, clear dashboard that automatically flags critical threats. The system should remove the noise and present clear, data-driven recommendations for action.
*   **For the Barangay Captain:** Receiving a direct, unambiguous SMS alert with specific instructions, empowering them to lead their community with confidence.
*   **For the Citizen:** Receiving a timely, easy-to-understand warning in their local dialect via SMS or radio, giving them enough time to secure their property, livestock, and family.

## 3. User Experience Goals

*   **Clarity:** The system must translate complex data into simple, actionable instructions.
*   **Credibility:** The alerts must be accurate and hyper-local to build trust.
*   **Accessibility:** The system must use low-tech, ubiquitous channels (SMS, radio) to ensure 100% reach.
*   **Efficiency:** The system should reduce the cognitive load on disaster managers, allowing them to focus on decision-making, not data analysis.
