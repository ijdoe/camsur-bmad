# Active Context: Project LINGKOD MVP Development

## 1. Current Work Focus

The primary focus is on achieving **full BMAD methodology compliance**. We have paused all new feature development to reorganize our documentation, create missing deliverables, and establish formal process gates. This is a critical step to ensure the project is built on a solid, traceable, and high-quality foundation before proceeding with further implementation.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions

*   **Strategic Shift to Sales MVP:** The project focus has shifted from immediate pilot implementation to developing a robust MVP for sales demonstrations, recognizing the need to secure contracts before further development.
*   **Multi-Region Demo Capability:** The MVP is designed to support demo scenarios for diverse regions, including complex urban environments like Metro Manila, showcasing the system's adaptability and scalability.
*   **Enterprise-Grade Tech Stack Selection:** A modern, future-proof tech stack has been selected, including NestJS (Node.js/TypeScript) for the backend, Next.js (React/TypeScript) with Tailwind CSS for the frontend, and a robust data layer (PostgreSQL/PostGIS, TimescaleDB, Redis, Elasticsearch).
*   **Detailed Technical Specification Created:** A comprehensive technical specification document (`docs/Project_LINGKOD_MVP_Technical_Specification.md`) has been created, outlining the architecture, data models, service specifications, and development guidelines for the MVP.
*   **Adoption of Dual-Mode Architecture:** A key strategic decision was made to position the system as a dual-mode solution. This allows it to be deployed as a complete, standalone platform for clients without existing systems, or as an "intelligence engine" that feeds alerts via API into a city's homegrown command center. This decision was made to increase adoption by complementing, rather than replacing, existing infrastructure.
*   **Invalidation of "AGRI-SIGURADO":** The agricultural intelligence concept was invalidated upon the discovery that our key partner, Coram.ai, specializes in AI-powered physical security and emergency management, not satellite-based agricultural analysis.
*   **Strategic Pivot to "LINGKOD":** A new project, "LINGKOD," was conceptualized to align perfectly with Coram.ai's actual capabilities.
*   **Adoption of Multi-Layered Intelligence:** The decision was made to re-integrate satellite imagery from a new, dedicated provider.
*   **Narrative-Driven Proposal:** Based on user feedback, the decision was made to introduce a relatable, story-based section into the proposal to better illustrate the project's human impact.
*   **GIS Integration Scoping:** The technical scope was enhanced to support integration with platforms like ArcGIS by adding GeoJSON compatibility to the complementary API feed.
*   **Detailed Workflow Definition:** A comprehensive system workflow document (`docs/System_Workflow.md`), including a visual diagram, was created to map the end-to-end logic of the `ThreatAnalysisEngine`.
*   **Communication Template Drafting:** Initial communication templates (`docs/Communication_Templates.md`) for SMS, radio, and official alerts were created.
*   **Strategic Clarification:** `systemPatterns.md` was updated to distinguish Project LINGKOD's role as a proactive "Intelligence Engine" from a reactive 911 dispatch system.
*   **BMAD Compliance Initiative:** Executed a comprehensive plan to align the project with the BMAD methodology. This involved:
    *   **Process Documentation:** Created formal guides for the BMAD process, phase gates, and templates.

    *   **Deliverable Creation:** Created all missing design and architecture documents, including a design system, mockup descriptions, ADRs, and security/performance specifications.
    *   **Development Pause:** Halted new feature development to focus on process alignment.
    *   **Requirements Gate Finalization:** Completed all deliverables for the Requirements Gate. This included restoring the `provincial-rollout-plan.md` and `provincial-rollout-proposal.md`, creating the missing `business-case.md`, and verifying that all financial figures are in full alignment with the `internal-costing-guide.md`.
    *   **Proposal Finalization:** The `provincial-rollout-proposal.md` was updated with a total estimated investment summary, providing a clear, high-level budget overview for the entire provincial rollout. The proposal is now considered final and ready for presentation.
    *   **Requirements Gate Sign-Off:** Created formal sign-off document (`docs/bmad/reviews/requirements-gate-review.md`) and updated the development readiness checklist to officially mark the Requirements Gate as PASSED.
    *   **Design Gate Sign-Off:** Created formal sign-off document (`docs/bmad/reviews/design-gate-review.md`) and updated the development readiness checklist to officially mark the Design Gate as PASSED. All design deliverables including UX specifications, design system, mockups, and prototypes have been reviewed and approved.
    *   **Component Specifications Completed:** Created detailed specifications for the three missing components (`table.md`, `alert.md`, `dropdown.md`) to complete the design system. All component specifications are now developer-ready with comprehensive details on variants, states, accessibility, and usage examples.
    *   **Architecture Gate Sign-Off:** Created formal sign-off document (`docs/bmad/reviews/architecture-gate-review.md`) and updated the development readiness checklist to officially mark the Architecture Gate as PASSED. All architecture deliverables have been reviewed and approved.
*   **Proposal Enhancement Based on Partner Feedback:** In response to partner feedback requesting more detail on platform functionalities and value beyond costing, the proposal documents were significantly enhanced:
    *   **Added "Insight Catalog":** Introduced a detailed Phase 1 Insight Catalog including Barangay Flood Watch, Landslide Watch, Quake Rapid Impact Estimation, Hotspot Escalation Score, Critical Facility Impact, and Route Vulnerability Advisory. This demonstrates how the platform provides actionable, predictive insights rather than just data aggregation.
    *   **Created Executive Brief:** Developed a one-page `executive-brief.md` for the governor, summarizing the vision, key outcomes, and deliverables in a concise, high-impact format.
    *   **Deliverables-to-Investment Map:** Added a clear mapping of investment items to tangible deliverables, ensuring transparency and value articulation.
    *   **Aligned All Documents:** Updated `provincial-rollout-plan.md` and `sales-enablement.md` to reflect the new messaging, including a narrative-driven demo script focused on "insights, not just data."
*   **Phase 1 Implementation Plan Finalized:** Decided on a no-MoU approach for Phase 1, leveraging public data sources (PAGASA, PHIVOLCS, NAMRIA, MGB, PSA) to deliver a strong MVP without external dependencies. This includes adapters for data ingestion, rules for insight generation, and UI for operator workflows.
*   **Incorporated Partner's Insight Emphasis:** Emphasized throughout the documents that the platform provides "meaningful insights" from data fusion, not just aggregation, with explainable evidence panels and human-in-the-loop approval.
*   **Document Alignment for Insight-Driven Narrative:** Updated all foundational project documents to align with the new insight-driven approach:
    *   **Project Brief:** Reframed the core goal to emphasize transforming raw data into actionable, predictive insights.
    *   **Product Requirements Document:** Added formal "Insight Generation & Management" section with the Phase 1 Insight Catalog.
    *   **UX Specification:** Updated workflows and UI components to focus on "Insight Cards," "Priority Queue," and "Evidence Panel."
    *   **Epic 7.2:** Renamed to "Insight Generation Engine" and updated user stories to focus on building specific insights from the catalog.
*   **Strategic Partnership with RDG Digital Consulting:** Established RDG Digital Consulting as our exclusive Reseller and Implementation Partner for the LGU sector in the Philippines. This positions RDG as the primary contractor for provincial implementations while Getaka Labs provides the core technology.
*   **Intellectual Property Model:** Defined a clear IP framework where Getaka Labs retains ownership of the core LINGKOD platform IP, but RDG can own IP for bespoke customizations developed specifically for their clients. This creates a mutually beneficial revenue-sharing model for future deployments.
*   **Proposal Reframing as B2B Document:** Transformed the provincial rollout proposal from a direct client proposal to a B2B partnership document from Getaka Labs to RDG Digital Consulting, equipping them with the technical details needed for their bid to the provincial government.
*   **Feature Roadmap Alignment:** Clarified that the initial proposal costing covers Phase 1 (MVP) features, with advanced capabilities from Phase 2 and 3 (Community Intelligence Module, Dynamic Briefing Dashboard, advanced analytics) to be scoped and costed separately in future partnership phases.
*   **Authentication System Debugging:** Resolved a critical authentication issue that was preventing users from logging in. The debugging process involved:
    *   **Password Hashing:** Corrected the password hashing logic in the `AuthService` to ensure passwords are not stored in plain text.
    *   **Database Seeding:** Re-ran the database seed script to populate the database with correctly hashed passwords.
    *   **Environment Variables:** Created a dedicated `.env` file for the backend and configured the application to load the `JWT_SECRET` from it.
    *   **Server Restart:** Restarted the backend server to apply all changes.
    *   **Frontend Logic:** Corrected the frontend logic to ensure the `access_token` is correctly handled and the user is redirected to the admin dashboard after a successful login.

4.  **TypeScript Error Resolution:** All TypeScript errors that arose from the component refactoring have been resolved, ensuring a stable codebase.

### Next Phase: Design QA & Feature Development

With the foundational component library in place, the next phase of work will involve:

1.  **Design QA in Storybook:** A thorough review of the implemented components in Storybook to ensure they perfectly match the UX specifications. **(Completed)**
    *   Storybook has been installed, configured, and populated with stories for all core UI components. The environment is now ready for a full design review.
2.  **Resume Feature Development:** Continue with the implementation of the remaining application features, leveraging the new, robust component library to ensure a high-quality and consistent user experience. **(In Progress)**
    *   Implemented the core dashboard layout and integrated all major UI components.
    *   Created a data fetching layer with `react-query` to populate the dashboard with real-time data.
    *   Established mock API endpoints to provide data during development.
- **Dropdown Component Fix:** Fixed a bug where the dropdown component had a transparent background, making it difficult to read. The issue was resolved by applying a standard Tailwind CSS background color directly to the component, which ensures it displays correctly in both light and dark modes.
- **InsightCard Text Overflow Fix:** Resolved a UI bug in the `InsightCard` component where text would overflow its container when displayed in a grid view. The fix involved adjusting the flexbox properties of the card's internal layout to ensure proper text truncation.
- **UI Polish Pass:** Conducted a UI polish pass to prepare for client demos. This included resizing icons in the main navigation for consistency and adding visual separators in the main dashboard for better layout clarity.
- **Interactive Map Integration:** Completed the integration of the interactive map component. This involved refactoring the `MapComponent` to use dynamic data, unifying data types across all map-related components (`DashboardContainer`, `InteractiveMapContainer`, `MapComponent`) to ensure type safety, and wiring up the click handlers for interactive info panels.
- **Insight Detail Panel Fixes:** Resolved two UI issues in the `InsightDetailPanel`. First, corrected a dark mode visibility bug where the insight title was unreadable by applying the correct text color. Second, restored the missing sample evidence data by updating the mock API endpoint, ensuring the component displays data correctly for demos.
- **Mock Recommendations Added:** Added mock recommendation data to the insights API endpoint to populate the "Recommendations" tab in the Insight Detail Panel, ensuring all tabs have sample data for demos.
- **Restored Mock Evidence for Insight #2:** Added mock evidence data for Insight #2 to the insights API endpoint, ensuring that all insights have complete sample data for demos.
