# Active Context: Project LINGKOD Pivot

## 1. Current Work Focus

The primary focus is the formalization of a new strategic direction for the CamSur provincial proposal. This involves documenting the pivot from the initial broad AI governance framework ("The Villafuerte AI Governance Framework") and the interim "AGRI-SIGURADO" concept to the final, targeted proposal: **"Project LINGKOD."**

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions

*   **Invalidation of "AGRI-SIGURADO":** The agricultural intelligence concept was invalidated upon the discovery that our key partner, Coram.ai, specializes in AI-powered physical security and emergency management, not satellite-based agricultural analysis.
*   **Strategic Pivot to "LINGKOD":** A new project, "LINGKOD," was conceptualized to align perfectly with Coram.ai's actual capabilities. This decision was made to leverage our existing partnerships for maximum impact and credibility.
*   **Adoption of Multi-Layered Intelligence:** The decision was made to retain the powerful concept of satellite imagery by proposing a partnership with a dedicated provider (e.g., Planet Labs). This creates a more robust, multi-layered situational awareness platform.
*   **Narrative-Driven Proposal:** Based on user feedback, the decision was made to introduce a relatable, story-based section into the proposal to better illustrate the project's human impact.

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Finalize Memory Bank:** Complete the creation of all core memory bank documents.
2.  **Commit to Version Control:** Add all new files (proposal and memory bank) to a Git repository, commit the changes, and push to a remote.

## 4. Important Patterns & Preferences

*   **Feedback-Driven Iteration:** The project's direction is highly responsive to stakeholder feedback. The pivot from the initial proposal to "LINGKOD" is a prime example of this.
*   **Partnership-Centric Solutions:** The strategy is to build solutions that leverage the specific, proven strengths of our technology partners.
*   **Human-Centric Storytelling:** Proposals and project descriptions should be framed with relatable narratives to communicate value effectively.
