# Active Context: Project LINGKOD Refinement

## 1. Current Work Focus

The primary focus is refining the strategic positioning of **Project LINGKOD**. Based on feedback regarding existing city-level command centers, the project is being updated to explicitly function as a **dual-mode system**: both a standalone platform and a complementary "intelligence engine." The current task is to update all project documentation (memory bank, proposal) to reflect this enhanced, more flexible architecture and messaging.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions

*   **Adoption of Dual-Mode Architecture:** A key strategic decision was made to position the system as a dual-mode solution. This allows it to be deployed as a complete, standalone platform for clients without existing systems, or as an "intelligence engine" that feeds alerts via API into a city's homegrown command center. This decision was made to increase adoption by complementing, rather than replacing, existing infrastructure.
*   **Invalidation of "AGRI-SIGURADO":** The agricultural intelligence concept was invalidated upon the discovery that our key partner, Coram.ai, specializes in AI-powered physical security and emergency management, not satellite-based agricultural analysis.
*   **Strategic Pivot to "LINGKOD":** A new project, "LINGKOD," was conceptualized to align perfectly with Coram.ai's actual capabilities.
*   **Adoption of Multi-Layered Intelligence:** The decision was made to retain the powerful concept of satellite imagery by proposing a partnership with a dedicated provider (e.g., Planet Labs).
*   **Narrative-Driven Proposal:** Based on user feedback, the decision was made to introduce a relatable, story-based section into the proposal to better illustrate the project's human impact.

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Align All Documentation:** Update all memory bank files and the main proposal document to consistently reflect the dual-mode architecture and "intelligence engine" messaging.
2.  **Commit to Version Control:** Once the documentation is aligned, add all changes to a Git repository, commit, and push to the remote.

## 4. Important Patterns & Preferences

*   **Feedback-Driven Iteration:** The project's direction is highly responsive to stakeholder feedback. The pivot to a dual-mode architecture is a prime example of this.
*   **Partnership-Centric Solutions:** The strategy is to build solutions that leverage the specific, proven strengths of our technology partners.
*   **Human-Centric Storytelling:** Proposals and project descriptions should be framed with relatable narratives to communicate value effectively.
