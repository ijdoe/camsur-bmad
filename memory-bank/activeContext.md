# Active Context: Project LINGKOD Refinement

## 1. Current Work Focus

The primary focus is on the **detailed technical scoping of the pilot program**. Now that the high-level strategy and dual-mode architecture are defined, the immediate task is to create the specific technical plans required to move the project from proposal to implementation. This involves defining data schemas, API endpoints, and initial analytical rules.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions

*   **Adoption of Dual-Mode Architecture:** A key strategic decision was made to position the system as a dual-mode solution. This allows it to be deployed as a complete, standalone platform for clients without existing systems, or as an "intelligence engine" that feeds alerts via API into a city's homegrown command center. This decision was made to increase adoption by complementing, rather than replacing, existing infrastructure.
*   **Invalidation of "AGRI-SIGURADO":** The agricultural intelligence concept was invalidated upon the discovery that our key partner, Coram.ai, specializes in AI-powered physical security and emergency management, not satellite-based agricultural analysis.
*   **Strategic Pivot to "LINGKOD":** A new project, "LINGKOD," was conceptualized to align perfectly with Coram.ai's actual capabilities.
*   **Adoption of Multi-Layered Intelligence:** The decision was made to retain the powerful concept of satellite imagery by proposing a partnership with a dedicated provider (e.g., Planet Labs).
*   **Narrative-Driven Proposal:** Based on user feedback, the decision was made to introduce a relatable, story-based section into the proposal to better illustrate the project's human impact.

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Finalize Pilot Technical Scope:** Complete the `docs/Pilot_Technical_Scope.md` document with input from technology partners.
2.  **Formalize Partnerships:** Use the technical scope document as a basis for drafting formal agreements with Coram.ai, DMA-BD, and a satellite provider.
3.  **Begin Pilot Development:** Commence the initial development sprints focused on data ingestion and the core `ThreatAnalysisEngine`.
4.  **Commit to Version Control:** Ensure all new documentation and code are committed and pushed to the remote repository.

## 4. Important Patterns & Preferences

*   **Feedback-Driven Iteration:** The project's direction is highly responsive to stakeholder feedback. The pivot to a dual-mode architecture is a prime example of this.
*   **Partnership-Centric Solutions:** The strategy is to build solutions that leverage the specific, proven strengths of our technology partners.
*   **Human-Centric Storytelling:** Proposals and project descriptions should be framed with relatable narratives to communicate value effectively.
