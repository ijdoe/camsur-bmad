# Active Context: Project LINGKOD MVP Development

## 1. Current Work Focus

The primary focus is on achieving **full BMAD methodology compliance**. We have paused all new feature development to reorganize our documentation, create missing deliverables, and establish formal process gates. This is a critical step to ensure the project is built on a solid, traceable, and high-quality foundation before proceeding with further implementation.

## 2. Recent Changes & Decisions

*   **Strategic Shift to Sales MVP:** The project focus has shifted from immediate pilot implementation to developing a robust MVP for sales demonstrations, recognizing the need to secure contracts before further development.
*   **Multi-Region Demo Capability:** The MVP is designed to support demo scenarios for diverse regions, including complex urban environments like Metro Manila, showcasing the system's adaptability and scalability.
*   **Enterprise-Grade Tech Stack Selection:** A modern, future-proof tech stack has been selected, including NestJS (Node.js/TypeScript) for the backend, Next.js (React/TypeScript) with Tailwind CSS for the frontend, and a robust data layer (PostgreSQL/PostGIS, TimescaleDB, Redis, Elasticsearch).
*   **Detailed Technical Specification Created:** A comprehensive technical specification document (`docs/Project_LINGKOD_MVP_Technical_Specification.md`) has been created, outlining the architecture, data models, service specifications, and development guidelines for the MVP.
*   **Adoption of Dual-Mode Architecture:** A key strategic decision was made to position the system as a dual-mode solution. This allows it to be deployed as a complete, standalone platform for clients without existing systems, or as an "intelligence engine" that feeds alerts via API into a city's homegrown command center. This decision was made to increase adoption by complementing, rather than replacing, existing infrastructure.
*   **Invalidation of "AGRI-SIGURADO":** The agricultural intelligence concept was invalidated upon the discovery that our key partner, Coram.ai, specializes in AI-powered physical security and emergency management, not satellite-based agricultural analysis.
*   **Strategic Pivot to "LINGKOD":** A new project, "LINGKOD," was conceptualized to align perfectly with Coram.ai's actual capabilities.
*   **Adoption of Multi-Layered Intelligence:** The decision was made to re-integrate satellite imagery from a new, dedicated provider.
*   **Narrative-Driven Proposal:** Based on user feedback, the decision was made to introduce a relatable, story-based section into the proposal to better illustrate the project's human impact.
*   **GIS Integration Scoping:** The technical scope was enhanced to support integration with platforms like ArcGIS by adding GeoJSON compatibility to the complementary API feed.
*   **Detailed Workflow Definition:** A comprehensive system workflow document (`docs/System_Workflow.md`), including a visual diagram, was created to map the end-to-end logic of the `ThreatAnalysisEngine`.
*   **Communication Template Drafting:** Initial communication templates (`docs/Communication_Templates.md`) for SMS, radio, and official alerts were created.
*   **Strategic Clarification:** `systemPatterns.md` was updated to distinguish Project LINGKOD's role as a proactive "Intelligence Engine" from a reactive 911 dispatch system.
*   **BMAD Compliance Initiative:** Executed a comprehensive plan to align the project with the BMAD methodology. This involved:
    *   **Process Documentation:** Created formal guides for the BMAD process, phase gates, and templates.
    *   **Documentation Reorganization:** Restructured the entire `docs` directory to align with BMAD phases.
    *   **Deliverable Creation:** Created all missing design and architecture documents, including a design system, mockup descriptions, ADRs, and security/performance specifications.
    *   **Development Pause:** Halted new feature development to focus on process alignment.
    *   **Requirements Gate Finalization:** Completed all deliverables for the Requirements Gate. This included restoring the `provincial-rollout-plan.md` and `provincial-rollout-proposal.md`, creating the missing `business-case.md`, and verifying that all financial figures are in full alignment with the `internal-costing-guide.md`.
    *   **Proposal Finalization:** The `provincial-rollout-proposal.md` was updated with a total estimated investment summary, providing a clear, high-level budget overview for the entire provincial rollout. The proposal is now considered final and ready for presentation.
    *   **Requirements Gate Sign-Off:** Created formal sign-off document (`docs/bmad/reviews/requirements-gate-review.md`) and updated the development readiness checklist to officially mark the Requirements Gate as PASSED.
    *   **Design Gate Sign-Off:** Created formal sign-off document (`docs/bmad/reviews/design-gate-review.md`) and updated the development readiness checklist to officially mark the Design Gate as PASSED. All design deliverables including UX specifications, design system, mockups, and prototypes have been reviewed and approved.
    *   **Component Specifications Completed:** Created detailed specifications for the three missing components (`table.md`, `alert.md`, `dropdown.md`) to complete the design system. All component specifications are now developer-ready with comprehensive details on variants, states, accessibility, and usage examples.
    *   **Architecture Gate Sign-Off:** Created formal sign-off document (`docs/bmad/reviews/architecture-gate-review.md`) and updated the development readiness checklist to officially mark the Architecture Gate as PASSED. All architecture deliverables have been reviewed and approved.
*   **Proposal Enhancement Based on Partner Feedback:** In response to partner feedback requesting more detail on platform functionalities and value beyond costing, the proposal documents were significantly enhanced:
    *   **Added "Insight Catalog":** Introduced a detailed Phase 1 Insight Catalog including Barangay Flood Watch, Landslide Watch, Quake Rapid Impact Estimation, Hotspot Escalation Score, Critical Facility Impact, and Route Vulnerability Advisory. This demonstrates how the platform provides actionable, predictive insights rather than just data aggregation.
    *   **Created Executive Brief:** Developed a one-page `executive-brief.md` for the governor, summarizing the vision, key outcomes, and deliverables in a concise, high-impact format.
    *   **Deliverables-to-Investment Map:** Added a clear mapping of investment items to tangible deliverables, ensuring transparency and value articulation.
    *   **Aligned All Documents:** Updated `provincial-rollout-plan.md` and `sales-enablement.md` to reflect the new messaging, including a narrative-driven demo script focused on "insights, not just data."
*   **Phase 1 Implementation Plan Finalized:** Decided on a no-MoU approach for Phase 1, leveraging public data sources (PAGASA, PHIVOLCS, NAMRIA, MGB, PSA) to deliver a strong MVP without external dependencies. This includes adapters for data ingestion, rules for insight generation, and UI for operator workflows.
*   **Incorporated Partner's Insight Emphasis:** Emphasized throughout the documents that the platform provides "meaningful insights" from data fusion, not just aggregation, with explainable evidence panels and human-in-the-loop approval.
*   **Document Alignment for Insight-Driven Narrative:** Updated all foundational project documents to align with the new insight-driven approach:
    *   **Project Brief:** Reframed the core goal to emphasize transforming raw data into actionable, predictive insights.
    *   **Product Requirements Document:** Added formal "Insight Generation & Management" section with the Phase 1 Insight Catalog.
    *   **UX Specification:** Updated workflows and UI components to focus on "Insight Cards," "Priority Queue," and "Evidence Panel."
    *   **Epic 7.2:** Renamed to "Insight Generation Engine" and updated user stories to focus on building specific insights from the catalog.
*   **Strategic Partnership with RDG Digital Consulting:** Established RDG Digital Consulting as our exclusive Reseller and Implementation Partner for the LGU sector in the Philippines. This positions RDG as the primary contractor for provincial implementations while Getaka Labs provides the core technology.
*   **Intellectual Property Model:** Defined a clear IP framework where Getaka Labs retains ownership of the core LINGKOD platform IP, but RDG can own IP for bespoke customizations developed specifically for their clients. This creates a mutually beneficial revenue-sharing model for future deployments.
*   **Proposal Reframing as B2B Document:** Transformed the provincial rollout proposal from a direct client proposal to a B2B partnership document from Getaka Labs to RDG Digital Consulting, equipping them with the technical details needed for their bid to the provincial government.
*   **Feature Roadmap Alignment:** Clarified that the initial proposal costing covers Phase 1 (MVP) features, with advanced capabilities from Phase 2 and 3 (Community Intelligence Module, Dynamic Briefing Dashboard, advanced analytics) to be scoped and costed separately in future partnership phases.

## 4. Next Steps

### Immediate Task: Stabilize New Frontend Project (`frontend-new`)

We are currently focused on creating a stable, client-facing demo for the Project LINGKOD dashboard. This involves migrating from the old `frontend` project to a new, clean Next.js project (`frontend-new`) to resolve persistent configuration and dependency issues.

1.  **Install Missing Dependencies**: Compare `frontend/package.json` with `frontend-new/package.json` and install all missing packages.
2.  **Fix Import Paths**: Correct all import statements in the migrated components to use the proper path alias or relative paths.
3.  **Verify Demo**: Restart the development server and ensure the demo page at `http://localhost:3000/demo` renders correctly.
4.  **Cleanup**: Once the new project is confirmed to be working, the old `frontend` directory will be removed.

### Post-Migration Next Steps

1.  **Phase 4: Templates** - Create page layouts combining organism components into complete dashboard views.
2.  **Integration Testing** - End-to-end testing of component interactions and data flow.
3.  **Performance Optimization** - Bundle analysis, lazy loading, and rendering optimizations.
4.  **Demo Preparation** - Configure components for sales demonstrations with sample data.
5.  **Documentation Enhancement** - API documentation and developer guides for the component library.
