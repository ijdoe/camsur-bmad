# Project LINGKOD: A Provincial Situational Awareness Platform for Camarines Sur

## 1. Project Goal

The primary goal of Project LINGKOD is to develop a single, high-impact, technology-driven solution to enhance provincial disaster resilience and response capabilities for Camarines Sur.

## 2. The Problem

This project addresses the need for a practical application of advanced technology (AI, IoT, Satellite Imagery) that complements and empowers existing, trusted communication channels, rather than replacing them. It is a direct response to the practical, on-the-ground realities of the province.

## 3. The Solution

Project LINGKOD is a focused disaster management platform that integrates:
*   **Satellite Data:** For macro-level environmental analysis.
*   **AI-Powered CCTV Analysis:** For real-time monitoring of critical infrastructure.
*   **On-the-Ground IoT Sensors:** For hyper-local environmental data.

This data is fused in a central **Threat Analysis Engine** to provide a comprehensive situational awareness dashboard. A key component is the "last-mile" communication system that disseminates clear, actionable alerts via SMS, radio, and to barangay officials.
